1. Impaired consciousness (quantitative) – **observer rating**

**Definition**
Disturbance of wakefulness.

**Explanations and examples**
This is a *quantitative* feature. The neurophysiological term *vigilance* is used in a similar way. Disturbances of wakefulness range from drowsiness via somnolence and sopor up to coma.

**Examples: Impaired consciousness**
Impairments of consciousness are recognized by the degree of sleepiness:

* Patients are sleepy to varying degrees, slowed, and limited in their cognitive performance.
* In severe cases, contact with reality is completely lost.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – The patient is drowsy or sleepy but still responds to being addressed.
* **“severe”** – The patient can only be aroused by painful stimuli or no longer at all.

**To be distinguished from**

* 2 Clouding of consciousness
* 3 Narrowing of consciousness

### 
2. Clouding of consciousness – **observer rating**

**Definition**
Qualitative disturbance of clarity of consciousness. The ability to understand different aspects of one’s own person and environment, to connect them meaningfully, to communicate accordingly, and to act in a meaningful way is impaired.

**Explanations and examples**
Clouding of consciousness leads to an impairment of the whole subjective experience. Partial symptoms can be, for example, withdrawal from the outside world, poor comprehension, distractibility, or “heavy-mindedness.” Clouding of consciousness can occur, for example, in delirium, acute psychotic states, or intoxication.

**Examples: Clouding of consciousness**

* A patient reports separate episodes of their life story only vaguely and can bring them together into a coherent biography only with great difficulty.
* A patient has trouble understanding what is happening in their current situation and deriving meaningful actions from it.
* A patient is unable to act, because he does not understand the interaction with other people, his own role within it, and the circumstances of the environment.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Clouding of consciousness leads to minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Clouding of consciousness leads to significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 1 Impaired consciousness (quantitative)
* 3 Narrowing of consciousness

---

### 
3. Narrowing of consciousness – **self- and observer rating**

**Definition**
Narrowing of the entire experience and behavior with reduced responsiveness to external stimuli.

**Explanations and examples**
For understanding this *qualitative* feature, the metaphor of the “spotlight of consciousness” is useful. It refers to a narrow and at the same time little-movable cone of light in which experienced events are perceived clearly or even overly clearly, whereas things at the edge or outside this light are not perceived or only vaguely perceived. The patient appears fixated on and fascinated by certain inner experiences or external circumstances (“tunnel vision,” “blinkers”). The feature is seen not only in mental disorders such as twilight states or acute stress reactions, but also under hypnosis or in extreme concentration on a particular topic (e.g. solving a difficult problem).

**Examples: Narrowing of consciousness**

* The whole experience and behavior are focused on one topic.
* After a traffic accident, a patient appears dazed, but the police officers can quickly obtain detailed information about the events in conversation.
* The patient listens to their voices. Attempts to redirect them to other topics are left unanswered or receive only a brief, hinted reaction before the patient turns back to their inner experience.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – The narrowing can be broken through easily. Communication with the patient is at most slightly impaired.
* **“severe”** – The narrowing can only be influenced with difficulty. Communication with the patient is considerably restricted.

**To be distinguished from**

* 1 Impaired consciousness (quantitative)
* 2 Clouding of consciousness
* 18 Restricted / narrowed thinking

### 
4. Shift of consciousness – **self-rating**

**Definition**
Patients report that their overall experience is more intense or clearer than usual.

**Explanations and examples**
Shift of consciousness, sometimes also called *expansion of consciousness*, can be characterized by a feeling of expansion of inner experience. Patients feel overall more awake, more alive, more open. Feelings or sensory perceptions (e.g. sounds, colors) are experienced as particularly intense. Shifts of consciousness may occur under drugs or within psychotic symptomatology. Meditative states can also lead to a shift of consciousness.

**Examples: Shift of consciousness**

* Patients report a subjective feeling of inner enrichment/expansion of their experience.
* Patients report the experience of perceiving impressions from the environment more vividly and alertly.
* Patients report a feeling of improved comprehension.
* Other patients describe feeling completely overwhelmed by stimulus overload and by the intensity of these perceptions.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – A shift of consciousness should only cause minor distress or minor impairment.
* **“severe”** – A shift of consciousness leads to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 33 Delusional mood
* 53 Derealization

---

### 
5. Disorientation in time – **self-rating**

**Definition**
The date (day, month, year), day of the week, or season is not known or only vaguely known.

**Explanations and examples**
Before making a final assessment in the case of a slightly incorrect answer, the patient should be given the opportunity to correct themselves; that is, they should be told that the answer is wrong. If they then correct their answer without further help, the initial (wrong) answer is not counted as disorientation. A *time-grid disturbance* (Zeitgitterstörung), i.e. the inability to put memory contents into the correct temporal order, is not to be coded as disorientation in time but as a memory disorder.

**Examples: Disorientation in time**

* A patient cannot name the current day of the week.
* A patient cannot state the current year even with help.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – The answer regarding calendar date or weekday deviates by at most one day from the correct answer (even after being told the first answer was incorrect); month, year, and season are still known.
* **“severe”** – The month is not known correctly despite being told that the first answer was wrong, or the answer for the year deviates by more than one year from the correct year.

**To be distinguished from**

* 10 Disturbances of concentration
* 12 Memory disorders

---

### 
6. Disorientation in place – **self-rating**

**Definition**
The current place of stay is not known, or the patient gives only vague information about it.

**Explanations and examples**
If the patient does not know their current location (town name, district, etc.) only because they were not informed about it (e.g. during transfers in inpatient treatment), “no statement possible” should be marked rather than a disturbance. If a patient does not find their way around in the environment (for example cannot find their room on the ward), this should not be coded as disorientation in place but as a memory disorder. This is not a disturbance of orientation to place, but of orientation in *space*, which presupposes memory.

**Examples: Disorientation in place**

* There is uncertainty about the current place of stay.
* The place is not known even with help.
* A patient states that he is currently in a hotel instead of a hospital.
* A patient knows that she is in Bavaria but cannot name the city.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Disorientation in place should only cause minor distress or minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Disorientation in place leads to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 7 Disorientation regarding situation
* 12 Memory disorders

---

### 
7. Disorientation regarding situation – **self-rating**

**Definition**
The current situation is captured only vaguely or not at all in its meaning and context.

**Explanations and examples**
Disorientation regarding situation means an impaired or absent grasp and interpretation of the patient’s current situation in its meaningful context. A deep understanding of the patient’s health status is not required. What is meant is an understanding of the immediate situation (e.g. that the patient is having a conversation with a therapist, or is in a hospital because of illness).

**Examples: Disorientation regarding situation**

* A person has difficulties stating that they are currently a patient undergoing an examination.
* A patient does not know that he is in a hospital and speaking to a doctor.
* A patient cannot, even with help, recognize that he is in a psychiatric evaluation.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Disorientation regarding situation should only cause minor distress or minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Disorientation regarding situation leads to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 6 Disorientation in place

---

### 
8. Disorientation regarding own person – **self-rating**

**Definition**
The personal biographical situation is not known or only vaguely known.

**Explanations and examples**
Disorientation regarding one’s own person can affect all important autobiographical facts, referring to the present and past.

**Examples: Disorientation regarding own person**

* A patient does not know their role in terms of life stage and social context (e.g. occupation).
* A patient does not know their home address.
* A patient does not know how old they are.
* A patient does not know how many children they have.
* A patient does not know their birthday.
* A patient does not know their own name.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Disorientation regarding own person should only cause minor distress or minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Disorientation regarding own person leads to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 12 Memory disorders

---

### 
9. Disturbances of comprehension – **self- and observer rating**

**Definition**
Disturbance of the ability to understand utterances and texts in their meaning.

**Explanations and examples**
What is meant is the cognitive processing of received information. Comprehension may be more or less incorrect, “heavy-minded,” or absent. Disturbances of comprehension can become apparent in the conversation or in clinical testing. Testing can be done, for example, with word pairs (similarities, differences), common proverbs, picture stories, or fables, if the disturbance is not already apparent from the conversation. *Concrete thinking* (concretism) is also reflected here: an impairment of the ability for abstract-symbolic thinking. Examples include difficulties assigning elements to classes, problems with generalizations, and literal interpretations where metaphorical meaning is intended.

**Examples: Disturbances of comprehension**

* The patient does not understand questions and they must be additionally explained by the examiner.
* Proverbs are interpreted inaccurately or incorrectly.
* Fables are interpreted inaccurately or incorrectly.
* A patient explains a proverb in a concrete, literal way.
* Simple instructions cannot be carried out or are not understood.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Disturbances of comprehension should only cause minor distress or minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Disturbances of comprehension lead to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 10 Disturbances of concentration
* 23 Talking past the point

---

###
 10. Disturbances of concentration – **self- and observer rating**

**Definition**
Reduced ability to direct attention persistently to an activity or topic.

**Explanations and examples**
Disturbances of concentration are often also called *attention disturbances* and are sometimes used synonymously in clinical practice. They may show themselves already in the conversation or in clinical testing. For testing, tasks such as “subtract 4 repeatedly starting from 81” or “name the months of the year backwards” can be used. It must be ensured that the patient is in principle able to perform simple subtraction tasks or to name the months in the correct order. Disturbances of concentration in examinations manifest less through the absolute number of mistakes and more through an increase in mistakes over time, or through slowing and eventually stopping a task already started. Disturbances of concentration may also be plausibly reported by the patient.

**Examples: Disturbances of concentration**

* The patient reports that when reading a book or newspaper, their thoughts wander off after a few minutes.
* In conversation, the patient repeatedly asks what question was just asked.
* The patient makes increasing errors when counting backwards or naming the months.
* A patient reports that the voices always distract her when she tries to read a book.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Disturbances of concentration should only cause minor distress or minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Disturbances of concentration lead to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 9 Disturbances of comprehension
* 11 Disturbances of immediate recall (Merkfähigkeit)
* 12 Memory disorders

---

###
 11. Disturbances of immediate recall (Merkfähigkeit) – **self- and observer rating**

**Definition**
Reduction or loss of the ability to remember new information over a period of 10 minutes.

**Explanations and examples**
Disturbances of immediate recall can be plausibly reported by the patient, observed in conversation, or tested clinically. Immediate recall depends on the affective meaning of the material, so neutral terms should be used for testing, as far as possible. For comparability, the same material (e.g. the terms “34, Oslo, ashtray”) should always be used. If the patient does not recall the terms spontaneously, help may be given (e.g. “One of the terms was a number”). If the term is then recalled after help, this does *not* count as a disturbance.

**Examples: Disturbances of immediate recall**

* A patient reports that he forgets everything immediately and can give plausible examples.
* A patient cannot remember the questions asked and repeatedly has to ask what the examiner wants to know, because she has forgotten the question.
* Of three given terms, only two are spontaneously recalled after 10 minutes.
* The three terms are not recalled after 10 minutes, even with help.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Disturbances of immediate recall should only cause minor distress or minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Disturbances of immediate recall lead to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 10 Disturbances of concentration
* 12 Memory disorders

---

###
 12. Memory disorders – **self- and observer rating**

**Definition**
Reduction or loss of the ability to store information for longer than 10 minutes and/or to retrieve learned material from memory.

**Explanations and examples**
Memory disorders can be plausibly reported by the patient and/or tested clinically. They may relate to recent or more distant events. Memory disorders also include amnesias (content-limited or time-limited memory gaps) and time-grid disturbances (inability to place memory contents in the correct temporal order).

**Examples: Memory disorders**

* A patient can remember certain events or information but no longer knows some important details.
* A patient cannot remember what he had for lunch yesterday.
* A patient states that he watched a film yesterday but no longer knows what it was about.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Memory disorders should only cause minor distress or minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Memory disorders lead to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 8 Disorientation regarding own person
* 11 Disturbances of immediate recall (Merkfähigkeit)

---

###
 13. Confabulations – **observer rating**

**Definition**
Memory gaps are filled with changing fabrications which are taken as real memories.

**Explanations and examples**
In confabulations, different answers are given to the same question at different times. Therefore, the same topic must be asked about repeatedly for assessment. The patient does not notice the inconsistency of their statements, because they have forgotten the actual facts and their previous answers. Confabulations always presuppose memory disorders, which must be coded in addition.

**Examples: Confabulations**

* Confabulations appear in conversation but do not substantially disturb the course of the interview.
* Numerous memory gaps are consistently filled with confabulations, considerably impairing communication.
* Asked what he lives on, a patient first answers “from my work,” later “from my pension,” and still later “from inherited money.”

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Confabulations cause minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Confabulations cause considerable impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 14 Paramnesias

---

###
 14. Paramnesias – **self-rating**

**Definition**
Distortions or deceptions of memory, intrusive memories, increased memory ability.

**Explanations and examples**
In contrast to most other AMDP features, paramnesias can appear in several different phenomena:

* False recognition or apparent familiarity (already seen, heard, experienced although this should not be possible: *déjà vu*) and apparent unfamiliarity (never seen, although it should be familiar: *jamais vu*).
* Ekmnesias (disturbances of the experience of time or temporal assignment, where the past is experienced as the present).
* Hypermnesias (increased ability to remember, e.g. photographic memory or in near-death experiences).
* Flashbacks and intrusions (intrusively recurring memories of a traumatic event).
* False memories (pseudo-memories, memory distortions, e.g. in the sense of *false memory syndrome*).

Delusional or delusionally reinterpreted memories are *not* coded here.

**Examples: Paramnesias**

* A patient states that he has the feeling he has already experienced a certain situation, although he is sure he has never been in it before (déjà vu).
* A patient believes she is living in a past time period (ekmnesia).
* A patient reports suddenly remembering in great detail events that he thought he had long forgotten (hypermnesia).
* A patient suddenly remembers a previous event after a specific trigger (e.g. car accident) (flashback).
* A patient reports memories of dramatic events that, in reality, cannot have occurred (e.g. false memory syndrome).
* Patients are repeatedly overwhelmed by memories of details of earlier sexual abuse (intrusions).

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Paramnesias should only cause minor distress or minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Paramnesias lead to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 13 Confabulations

###
 15. Inhibited thinking – **self-rating**

**Definition**
The patient subjectively experiences thinking as slowed down or blocked.

**Explanations and examples**
Patients report a subjectively perceived reduced speed of thinking. Many emphasize the peculiar quality of this reduced speed: thinking is experienced as moving against an inner resistance, as peculiarly viscous or blocked.

**Examples: Inhibited thinking**

* The patient reports that it is difficult to follow a coherent train of thought; he feels blocked in his thinking.
* A patient mentions that her thinking has become more sluggish recently.
* Patients state that this inhibition of thinking can only be overcome with effort and strain.
* Thought inhibition can extend to the subjective experience of no longer being able to think at all, of being blocked.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Inhibited thinking should only cause minor distress or minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Inhibited thinking leads to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 16 Slowed thinking
* 20 Brooding / ruminations

---

###
 16. Slowed thinking – **observer rating**

**Definition**
Thinking is slowed in tempo and dragging.

**Explanations and examples**
This feature refers to the externally observable reduction in the speed of thinking. It is sometimes difficult to assess, because the judgement depends in part on the examiner’s own notion of “normal.” It is advisable to take into account the “culturally usual” temperament of the patient.

**Examples: Slowed thinking**

* The conversation is sluggish.
* Throughout the conversation, response latencies are prolonged.
* There are long pauses that go beyond normal time needed for reflection.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Slowed thinking causes minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Slowed thinking causes considerable impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 15 Inhibited thinking
* 87 Mutism

---

###
 17. Circumstantial thinking – **observer rating**

**Definition**
Thinking that, in relation to the topic of conversation, does not distinguish the incidental from the essential, while the content-related connection is still maintained.

**Explanations and examples**
In circumstantial (sometimes also called “over-inclusive” or “over-elaborate”) thinking, the patient gets lost in unimportant details and sticks to them without losing the goal completely. They “go from one thing to another” but do not totally lose sight of the question. This often evokes impatience in the examiner.

**Examples: Circumstantial thinking**

* When asked how he came to the hospital, the patient describes in detail the route from home to the clinic.
* When explaining a fable, the patient never gets to the core of the story but gets bogged down in details that are not essential.
* Asked a simple question about the mother’s illnesses, the patient starts to recount, in detail, diseases of the entire family.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Circumstantial thinking causes only minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Circumstantial thinking causes considerable impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 9 Disturbances of comprehension
* 22 Flight of ideas

---

###
 18. Restricted / narrowed thinking – **observer rating**

**Definition**
Restriction of the range of thought content; being stuck on a topic or a few topics.

**Explanations and examples**
In conversation, the patient has difficulty moving from one topic to another or repeatedly returns to “their” topic. In the interview, various topics must be offered. This is important because the topic of illness will always be part of a clinical interview, but that alone does not indicate restricted thinking. Only within the topic of illness, if the patient is fixated on individual aspects and cannot be shifted despite other topics being offered, does this constitute restricted thinking.

**Examples: Restricted / narrowed thinking**

* A depressed patient repeatedly returns to his bowel problems, although the examiner wants to discuss other issues.
* A patient with grandiose delusions cannot disengage from them and does not respond to other topics offered.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Restricted thinking causes only minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Restricted thinking causes considerable impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 3 Narrowing of consciousness
* 20 Brooding / ruminations
* 30 Obsessive thoughts
* 19 Perseveration

---

###
 19. Perseveration – **observer rating**

**Definition**
Persistence in previously used words or statements that are no longer meaningful in the current context.

**Explanations and examples**
For evaluating this feature, the overall impression of the examiner is decisive: is the repetition of words still meaningful in the conversation context or not?

**Examples: Perseveration**

* A patient correctly labels a key as a “key.” Afterwards, however, he repeatedly says “key” mechanically when asked to state his name or to name other objects.
* A patient correctly answers the question about his date of birth but then gives the same date of birth as an answer to various unrelated questions.

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Perseveration causes minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Perseveration causes considerable impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 84 Parakinesias

---

###
 20. Brooding / ruminations – **self-rating**

**Definition**
Patients are repeatedly preoccupied with certain thoughts (circling thoughts), usually about unpleasant topics.

**Explanations and examples**
The patient reports that their thoughts circle again and again, without result, around the same (usually unpleasant) contents and can be interrupted only with difficulty. Rumination is experienced as unpleasant, bothersome, even tormenting. Often worries are the origin of these recurring, circling thoughts.

**Examples: Statements that may indicate brooding / ruminations**

* “I keep having to think about how things will go on for me.”
* “I have to think all day about whether I will get well again.”
* “My thoughts keep circling around whether anything bad might happen to my children.”
* “I can’t get rid of the thought that I may have done something wrong.”
* “I worry all day, and the thought that won’t let me go is how things are going to continue.”

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Rumination should only cause minor distress or minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Rumination leads to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 18 Restricted / narrowed thinking
* 21 Pressure of thought
* 30 Obsessive thoughts

---

###
 21. Pressure of thought – **self-rating**

**Definition**
The patient feels overwhelmed by a pressure of many different ideas or thoughts.

**Explanations and examples**
The patient cannot organize or control the multitude of intrusive ideas and thoughts. The thoughts can be meaningful or meaningless, racing or automatic. Thinking is usually experienced by the patient as accelerated, although it does not necessarily appear accelerated to the observer.

**Examples: Statements that may indicate pressure of thought**

* “So many thoughts go through my head that I can’t think clearly anymore.”
* “The many constantly new thoughts completely confuse me.”
* “I’m flooded by thoughts that I can’t defend myself against at all.”
* “The many thoughts create chaos in my head.”

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Pressure of thought should only cause minor distress or minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Pressure of thought leads to considerable distress or significant impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 20 Brooding / ruminations
* 30 Obsessive thoughts
* 57 Thought insertion

---

###
 22. Flight of ideas – **observer rating**

**Definition**
Increase in ideas that are no longer tightly guided by a goal. The goal of thinking can frequently shift or be lost due to associations.

**Explanations and examples**
The person with flight of ideas jumps from one thing to another and often does not finish a thought because their thinking is constantly diverted by intervening associations. The distraction from a coherent train of thought can be triggered by external stimuli (e.g. noises) or internal associations. Thinking does *not* have to be accelerated. Flight of ideas generally does not appear only at isolated points, but rather over longer phases in the conversation.

**Examples: Flight of ideas**

* A patient answers a question correctly but then adds further associations that move away from the original topic.
* A patient talks about UFOs, then associates to the painter Raphael, who also built flying machines, and continues that due to climate change she actually does not want to travel by plane anymore …

**Notes on grading**

* **“mild”** – Flight of ideas causes minor impairments.
* **“severe”** – Flight of ideas causes considerable impairments.

**To be distinguished from**

* 17 *Circumstantial thinking*
* 25 *Incoherent / disorganized thinking*
* 88 *Logorrhea*
* *Accelerated thinking* / *Speeded thinking*.



###
23. Talking past the point (Fremdeinschätzung)

**Definition**
The patient’s answers have no connection to the question asked, although follow-up questioning shows that the patient did understand the question.

**Explanations and examples**
Talking past the point (also called “derailment” in some systems) is not simply an incorrect answer. The decisive factor is that the patient *talks past* the content of the question. When suspected, the clinician must ensure the patient understood the question, e.g., by having them repeat it. Willfully evasive answers (e.g., “beating around the bush”), or mutual misunderstanding in everyday conversation, should not be coded here.

**Examples**
• Examiner: “Why did you come to the clinic yesterday?”
Patient: “The Chinese wall is over 5,000 km long.”
Examiner: “Do you recall what I asked?”
Patient: “Yes, you want to know why I came to the clinic yesterday.”

• Examiner: “Do you know something like an inner pressure?”
Patient: “Yes, I have high blood pressure.”
Examiner: “Do you recall my question?”
Patient: “Yes, you want to know whether I feel inner pressure.”

**Severity**
*Light:* causes only minor impairment.
*Severe:* causes significant impairment.

**Differential symptoms**
Disturbances of comprehension, concentration disturbances, restricted/narrowed thinking, incoherent/disorganized thinking.

---

###
24. Blocking / thought derailment (Self- and hetero-assessment)

**Definition**
Sudden interruption of an otherwise coherent train of thought or speech without an identifiable reason.

**Explanations and examples**
Observed externally as *blocking* or described by the patient as *thoughts suddenly stopping*. Minor everyday “losing the thread” does not qualify unless pronounced.

**Examples**
• The patient abruptly stops mid-sentence, becomes silent, and may resume with a completely different topic or ask for the previous question again.
• A patient reports that thoughts sometimes suddenly “disappear.”

**Severity**
*Light:* minor distress or impairment.
*Severe:* significant distress or impairment.

**Differential symptoms**
Concentration disturbances.

---

###
25. Incoherent / disorganized thinking (Fremdeinschätzung)

**Definition**
The patient’s thinking and speech lose logical and comprehensible structure for the examiner.

**Explanations**
Connections between thoughts become unrecognizable. Disturbances may range from paralogic thinking (logic distorted but syntax intact) to paragrammatism (disrupted syntax) to schizophasia (incomprehensible word/syllable salad). Typically persists over phases, not just isolated moments.

**Examples**
• “Yesterday afternoon I came to the clinic because there will be elections next year and the bakery opens at 8:00.” (Paralogic)
• “Earlier people were made of blue-eyed humans and how the brains accomplish.”
• Schizophasic utterances as in the German examples.

**Severity**
*Light:* mild impairment.
*Severe:* significant impairment.

**Differential symptoms**
Circumstantial thinking, flight of ideas.

---

###
26. Neologisms (Fremdeinschätzung)

**Definition**
Word creations or idiosyncratic word usages that do not follow linguistic norms and are often not immediately comprehensible.

**Explanations**
Includes not only invented words but also unusual semantic usage. In severe forms, the patient may create an entire artificial language. Slang or subcultural vocabulary is *not* coded here.

**Examples**
• “Yesterday I had a diagraf and my head was demachronized.”
• “My girlfriend is ‘the animal of number 7.’”

**Severity**
*Light:* mild impairment.
*Severe:* significant impairment.

**Differential symptoms**
Parakinesias, mannered/bizarre behavior, incoherent thinking.

---

###
27. Suspiciousness (Self- and hetero-assessment)

**Definition**
The behavior of others is perceived as directed negatively or hostilely toward oneself.

**Explanations**
Suspiciousness involves negatively tinted interpersonal interpretations, often inferred from interaction. Suspiciousness can appear within delusions and should then be coded in both places.

**Examples**
• “I have been disappointed so often; I trust no one anymore.”
• Patient repeatedly asks whether the recorder is *really* switched off.
• Doubts whether the examiner is truly a doctor.

**Severity**
Light vs. severe as above.

**Differential symptoms**
Dysphoria, irritability.

---

###
28. Hypochondria (Self-assessment)

**Definition**
Anxious preoccupation with bodily functions, accompanied by the unfounded belief of being ill or becoming ill.

**Explanations**
Normal bodily sensations become catastrophically interpreted. Content may change over time. Hypochondriacal *delusions* are coded under symptom 44.

**Examples**
• “I feel my heart pounding, that cannot be normal.”
• “I constantly fear I might get AIDS.”
• Persistent fear of illness despite reassurance.

**Severity**
Light vs. severe.

**Differential symptoms**
Phobias, anxiety.

---

###
29. Phobias (Self-assessment)

**Definition**
Fear of specific situations or objects, often leading to avoidance.

**Explanations**
Patients typically recognize the fear as irrational. Includes agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobias.
*Not* included: bodily fears (coded under hypochondria).

**Examples**
• Fear in enclosed spaces.
• Avoiding dogs despite knowing the fear is exaggerated.
• Avoidance of social situations.

**Severity**
Light vs. severe.

**Differential symptoms**
Hypochondria, anxiety.

---

###
30. Obsessive thoughts (Self-assessment)

**Definition**
Repetitive intrusive thoughts recognized as senseless or exaggerated but uncontrollable.

**Explanations**
Experienced as one’s own thoughts (not externally inserted). Distinct from compulsive impulses (which involve mental images of actions).

**Examples**
• Repeatedly thinking about whether the door is locked.
• Rechecking whether the mailbox was emptied.
• Needing to count from 1 to 100 repeatedly.

**Severity**
Light vs. severe.

**Differential symptoms**
Brooding/rumination, thought insertion.

---

###
31. Obsessive impulses (Self-assessment)

**Definition**
Intrusive impulses to perform certain actions, recognized as senseless and resisted.

**Explanations**
Aggressive or sexual themes common; impulses are rarely acted upon.

76. Parathymia (incongruent affect) (Hetero-assessment)

Definition
The affect displayed does not match the content of the reported experience.

Explanation and examples
Affect appears inappropriate to the topic of conversation.
Embarrassed or polite smiling (e.g., out of insecurity or to maintain composure) is not coded here.
If affect is restricted (affect poverty), parathymia can only be coded when the appropriate affective tone is potentially available. Example: A constantly laughing manic patient reporting a sad event while lacking the capacity for sadness is not parathymic.
Stereotyped laughing (not true affect) is coded under 84 Parakinesias.
Lack of affective expression in depressed patients is not coded here.

Examples
• A patient laughs while reporting having been horribly tortured the previous night.
• A patient expresses joy about a gift but complains and whimpers while doing so.

Severity
Light: minor impairment.
Severe: substantial impairment.

Differential symptoms
61 Restricted affect
84 Parakinesias

###
77. Affect lability (Self- and hetero-assessment)

Definition
Rapid shifts between different affects.

Explanation and examples
Affects switch rapidly, either spontaneously or triggered by external events.
Affects are short-lived; key is the rapid back-and-forth change.
Rapidly triggered but uncontrollable affects belong under 78 Affect incontinence.
Long-term mood fluctuations (e.g., bipolar) or day-to-day variation (“one day euphoric, next day depressed”) are not included here.
Circadian mood variations are coded separately.

Examples
• In movies, the patient cries quickly, then laughs in the next scene, then cries again.
• In conversation, they become irritated quickly, regain control, then are irritated again at the next topic.
• Patient briefly bursts into tears whenever a specific topic is mentioned.

Severity
Light vs. severe impairment.

Differential symptoms
78 Affect incontinence

###
78. Affect incontinence (Self- and hetero-assessment)

Definition
Affects are triggered by minimal stimuli and cannot be controlled.

Explanation and examples
Once triggered, the affect cannot be adequately suppressed or modulated.
Unlike affect lability, here the problem is loss of control of a single affect, not switching between affects. The term “affect permeability” is sometimes used.

Examples
• “I always cry when sad news comes on the radio, even though I don’t want to.”
• “Someone told a joke today and I couldn't stop laughing — it became embarrassing.”
• “My neighbor irritated me, and I couldn’t stop my anger; I eventually exploded.”
• “Whenever my wife’s death is mentioned, I fall into uncontrollable tears.”

Severity
Light vs. severe impairment.

Differential symptoms
77 Affect lability

###
79. Rigid / fixed affect (Hetero-assessment)

Definition
Reduced ability to modulate affective expression.

Explanation
Affects may occur, but each shows little to no modulation (flattened affect, reduced affective variability).
If no spontaneous modulation is observed, the clinician should apply emotional stimuli.
Distinct from affect poverty: here, the range of modulation, not the number of affects, is reduced.

Examples
• Patient appears emotionally static and lacks emotional dynamism.
• The range of affective expression is limited.

Severity
Light: modulation possible with external cues.
Severe: modulation does not increase even with strong stimuli.

Differential symptoms
61 Restricted affect

###

• Little movement, minimal spontaneous speech.
• “I do much less than before.”
• “I have less energy.”
• “Nothing interests me anymore.”
• “I am completely inactive.”
• “I feel paralyzed; I can’t do anything.”
