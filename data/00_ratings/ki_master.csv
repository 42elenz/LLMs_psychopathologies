no global confusion or disorganization is evident.","Although she frequently returns to the topic of wells/Sahara, her experience is not limited to a single theme; on the contrary, it is broad and easily distractible; she responds widely to external stimuli and changes in topics.","She reports feeling ""in great shape,"" ""brilliant,"" ""fantastic,"" allegedly needing only 1–2 hours of sleep without fatigue, feeling young, particularly capable, and ""born for greater things,"" and experiences many ideas and inner activity; this corresponds to a subjectively increased clarity/intensity of experience with significant social and financial consequences.","Upon inquiry, she correctly states the day of the week and date (""Thursday, 6th, February, 25th,"" according to the examiner's confirmation); temporal orientation is preserved.",She knows that she is in the ZI in Mannheim; that she does not know the ward name immediately after admission is to be expected and is not an indication of a disturbance of local orientation.,"She recognizes that she is a patient in the hospital, describes the closed door and the fact that she is not allowed to leave, and is able to correctly state at the end that the conversation is being recorded for scientific/educational purposes.","She knows her age range (""I am approaching 70""), origin (Feudenheim near Mannheim), marital status, relatives (husband, daughter), and biographical details; no indications of disorientation regarding her own person.","She understands questions and tasks, interprets proverbs correctly in terms of content (""Lies have short legs"" = one does not get far when lying), and can grasp abstractly what is meant by the proverbs; no overly literal or incorrect interpretation.","There are slight attention problems: distractibility during tasks (naming months, conversational digressions), errors in reciting the months backward (omissions, incorrect order), and slight imprecision in the memory task (number 26 instead of 24), but overall still largely feasible performance.","In the standardized memory test with the three terms (""Oslo, 24, ashtray""), after a few minutes she recalls ""ashtray, Oslo, and 26,"" thus only two terms correctly and one number incorrectly, despite her own assessment of having a ""fantastic"" memory; this indicates a mild reduction in memory capacity.","She is correctly oriented in time and place (date, day of the week, location, clinic), reports no amnesia or long-term memory gaps, and recalls biographical as well as culturally related content; she denies memory problems, thus there is no indication of a long-term memory disorder.","There are no identifiable memory gaps filled with varying fabricated content; upon repeated inquiries (e.g., duration of knowing Tom), the information remains consistent.","She reports neither déjà-vu/jamais-vu experiences, flashbacks, intrusions, nor other memory distortions or intrusive memories; corresponding symptoms are not addressed.","She describes herself as full of energy, with many ideas and without a subjective feeling of slowed or blocked thinking; rather, she experienced acceleration rather than inhibition of thinking.","In conversation, there is a high speech and thought tempo with rapid topic changes; there are no prolonged response latencies or sluggish conversational flow, thus no indication of slowed thinking.","She repeatedly gets lost in many peripheral details (handbag, clothing, prominent singers, sailing), goes ""from the hundredth to the thousandth,"" and answers questions only with extensive digressions, while the overall content coherence is largely maintained; this significantly impairs the flow of conversation (moderately circumstantial thinking).","Despite numerous digressions, she repeatedly returns to a few dominant themes (fountain in the Sahara, her own special ""calling,"" relationship with Tom, donations/projects) and remains strongly attached to them content-wise; other topics are quickly related back to these, indicating a clear, though not complete, narrowing of the scope of thought.","Although she emphasizes individual words (""stupid,"" ""top, top, top"") repeatedly, this occurs in a contextually appropriate situational context as affective reinforcement and not as meaningless perseveration on previous responses outside the respective context.","She describes many ideas and projects as positive and enjoyable (""I am doing great,"" ""I have many ideas""), without reporting distressing, recurrent, and difficult-to-interrupt worries or guilt thoughts; no indication of distressing, ruminative brooding in the sense of the AMDP.","The patient describes having ""far too much on her mind"" and ""many ideas,"" with her head full of plans; she experiences this more as pleasurable rather than as a strongly distressing pressure, which suggests mild thought pressure.","The conversation is noticeably erratic: she frequently switches from the current topic to associations (bag, sailing, gifts, celebrities, fairy tales), does not complete trains of thought, and is easily distracted, without completely losing coherence – this corresponds to a moderate degree of flight of ideas.","Despite thematic digressions, she answers most questions appropriately in terms of content; there is no evidence of systematically answering without any connection despite clearly understanding the topic of the question.","The flow of speech is consistently fluent and lively, without reported or observed sudden interruptions of thought or speech without external cause.","Despite abrupt topic changes, the formal coherence of the statements remains comprehensible, sentence structure and logic are essentially intact; no disintegration into unconnected sentence or word fragments.",There are no conspicuous neologisms or idiosyncratic word usages; slips of the tongue appear situational and not as systematic neologisms.,"Slightly suspicious tendencies: she refuses to provide information (""I won't tell you,"" ""it's nobody's business"") and assumes that the doctor might share it further; however, there is no pronounced anxious-hostile relatedness.","She reports that she is feeling ""excellent"" physically, currently has ""absolutely nothing,"" and shows no signs of excessive health anxiety or anxious self-monitoring.","Upon inquiry, she explicitly reports that she does not experience anxiety; phobia-typical, object- or situation-bound fears or avoidance are not described.","No repetitive, intrusive thoughts experienced as nonsensical with internal resistance are described.",The statement contains no indications of compelling action impulses experienced against internal resistance with a compulsive character.,No repetitive actions experienced as excessive or nonsensical with compulsive character are described.,"There is no description of a diffuse atmosphere of alteration, threat, or special significance of the environment; rather, the patient reports elevated mood and clarity of her mission without preceding unclear anticipatory tension.","Real perceptions (e.g., newspaper articles about Namibia/""extreme droughts,"" Sahara dust on cars) are interpreted as personal ""signs from above"" and confirmation of their special calling to well construction in the Sahara, without a rationally comprehensible cause; these delusional ascriptions of meaning are repeated and guide behavior.","The patient reports an ""inner certainty"" of being called from above to a mission, of being ""born for something greater,"" and of needing to improve the world through well construction in the Sahara, without any preceding concrete perception; this conviction arose spontaneously in thought and is experienced as self-evident.","For about two months, she has persistently adhered to fixed delusional beliefs (divine calling, special significance, large-scale well project in the Sahara, major concert at Wembley Stadium for funding), acted accordingly (large sums of money, organizational steps), and shows no capacity for criticism or insight into illness; the thoughts are enduring, unshakable, and clearly significantly influence her life conduct.","The delusional content is highly interconnected: divine calling, ""signs"" (article, dust), technical well prototype in the Lüneburg Heath, young Algerian friend and his family, transfers, sponsor contacts to celebrities, planning of a major concert at Wembley Stadium, etc.; from this arises a largely coherent, logically-paralogically structured ""story"" with few open questions.","The patient reports delusional themes with pronounced euphoria, overestimation of self (""born for something greater""), markedly increased drive (""I no longer need sleep,"" many projects simultaneously), irritable reaction to contradiction, and no questioning of these beliefs; the affective involvement in the delusional experience is very high and leads to significant interpersonal conflicts and inpatient admission.","Neutral events (press reports, Sahara dust) are repeatedly interpreted as messages/""signs"" specifically related to them for their personal mission; this self-referential relationship is delusionally certain and serves to confirm their special status, without, however, being at the center of an isolated delusion of reference.","Upon inquiry, the patient explicitly denies mistrust, feelings of being threatened or persecuted (""I do not know fear,"" no notion that someone wants to harm her); corresponding delusional content is not reported.",There is no evidence of delusional beliefs regarding the husband's infidelity; the patient devalues him but does not express suspicion of cheating.,"In response to the question about misconduct, she clearly denies it (""Why should I have done something wrong?""); no delusional exaggerated feelings of guilt.","Despite high expenses (several thousand euros), she expresses no concern about money or financial ruin (""No"" in response to the question about money worries); no delusional content related to impoverishment.","She reports that physically she feels ""fantastic"" and ""at the moment I have nothing at all""; no delusional conviction of being seriously ill.","Pronounced delusional self-aggrandizement: she considers herself ""something special,"" ""born for greater things,"" with a vocation ""bestowed from above"" to improve the world (well in the Sahara). She plans unrealistic large-scale projects (well construction in the Sahara, millions in funding, mega-concert at Wembley Stadium with international stars, herself as conférencière in a special dress) and has already invested substantial sums of money while disregarding criticism from her surroundings. Significant social and financial impairment, inpatient admission against her will → severe megalomania.","The delusional theme (calling from above, improving the world through Sahara wells) can already be represented as grandiose/delusions of grandeur; no additional different types of delusional content (e.g., persecutory, erotomanic, nihilistic delusions) are described.","No misinterpretations of real perceptions are described, and this phenomenon is not specifically inquired about.","In response to the explicit question about sensory distortions or hallucinations (""seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, that are not real""), she clearly denies this; no reports of hearing voices.",The patient generally denies auditory hallucinations; no reports of sounds without a real source (akoasms).,"Upon inquiry, she denies seeing things that others do not see and that are not real; no visual hallucinations reported.","Upon direct inquiry about hallucinations (""sensory distortions,"" ""seeing or hearing things... like hallucinations""), the patient explicitly denies these; there are no indications of tactile hallucinations or cenesthesias.","Hallucinations are overall denied (""No, I don't have that""), and no spontaneous reports of abnormal olfactory or gustatory sensations are given.","There are neither reports of an unreal or alien environment nor is this experience explicitly inquired about; thus, specific indications are lacking.","In response to the question about changes in the body (""felt that something has changed in her body""), she answers negatively (""No. Always remained the same. Yes, rather become younger"") and describes herself as special, young, and capable, without any experience of estrangement or unreality.",The direct question of whether others can read their thoughts is clearly denied; there is no indication that they experience their thoughts as spreading beyond the boundaries of the head or being directly accessible to others.,"An experience of thoughts being taken away or withdrawn is not described; when asked about influence on her thoughts, she entirely denies such experiences (""Never experienced anything like that"").","The question of whether others can influence their thoughts is denied (""Never experienced such a thing,"" ""I don't know that""); there is no evidence of thoughts experienced as foreign or made by others.","There is no inquiry as to whether feelings, actions, or bodily functions are experienced as being made from outside, nor are there any spontaneous corresponding descriptions.","The patient appears consistently oriented, confident, self-assured, and motivated, without a bewildered-helpless or confused-puzzled affect; rather, she demonstrates structured goals and no visible experience of perplexity.","She describes her mood as ""great,"" feels ""very well,"" emotionally lively and capable; no subjective experience of emotional impoverishment, inner emptiness, or emotional desolation is reported.","The patient exhibits a very lively, variable, and expressive emotional state (cheerful, angry, enthusiastic); no restricted affective range is observed.","She describes herself as physically fit, capable, full of energy, and without physical exhaustion (""I am doing great,"" ""I feel young, physically fit, capable""); no indications of reduced vitality.","She denies feeling ill, reports no sadness or depression, but consistently very good to elevated mood.","She describes optimistic, grand future plans (well construction, large concerts) without pessimistic expectations for the future or loss of hope.","Upon direct inquiry, she explicitly reports ""I do not know fear,"" and there are no indications of an anxious baseline mood or pronounced fears.","Markedly elevated well-being and elevated mood (""I feel great,"" ""mood is fantastic,"" ""super, super, super""), increased sense of vitality, reduced need for sleep (1–2 hours), grandiose ideas and unrealistic confidence with significant negative consequences (large sums of money given away, clinical admission).","Temporarily sullen and complaining towards the environment (""they are all stupid,"" ""fine people"" sarcastically), gets annoyed with daughter, husband, and neighbors, but without persistent pronounced irritability or significant distress.","She reports becoming rather ""irritated"" when she is not understood, confirms irritability upon inquiry, and there are repeated conflicts with family and neighbors (e.g., due to loud music at night); this results in significant interpersonal conflicts.","No explicit information regarding inner nervousness, agitation, or perceived inner tension; sufficient information is lacking in this regard.","Although she expresses complaints and criticism (about family, neighbors, handbag), this comes across more as joking rather than exaggerated lamenting with sighing or whining.","The patient repeatedly describes herself as particularly capable and special (""I am simply born for greater things,"" ""at the moment it is fantastic,"" ""I win them all""). There are no indications of reduced confidence in her own performance or self-worth, rather the opposite.","Markedly elevated self-esteem: She feels young, beautiful, highly capable (""absolutely, absolutely""), sees herself as ""born for greater things"" and ""something special,"" believes in a special calling ""from above,"" and grandiosely plans a worldwide well project with concerts at Wembley Stadium, where she herself acts as the master of ceremonies. She appears arrogant toward family (""stupid,"" ""as dumb as her father"") and makes uncritical financial contributions (several thousand euros) within the context of this overestimation of herself. This corresponds to a severe elevated self-esteem with impairments in daily functioning.","When directly asked if she felt she had done something wrong, she denies this (""No. Why should I have done something wrong?""). Despite conflicts with her family, she shows no self-reproach or subjectively experienced guilt.","Despite significant expenditures (several thousand euros, planning for millions), she explicitly expresses no concerns about money (""Nope"") and anticipates substantial income from planned events. There are no subjective fears of impoverishment or existential threats.","There are no clear indications of the simultaneous coexistence of contradictory feelings or impulses in the AMDP sense (e.g., simultaneous love and hate toward the same person). Present statements (e.g., sometimes feeling alone but receiving support from Tom) rather describe situation-dependent than simultaneously opposing affects. A definitive assessment of ambivalence is not possible.","The patient exhibits a consistently elevated, lively affect that corresponds in content to the reported positive experiences, projects, and subjectively good mood. A clearly inappropriate emotional expression in relation to the conversation content (e.g., laughing when reporting severe burdens) is not described. A definitive assessment is not possible.","Throughout the conversation, the patient appears consistently euphoric/pleasantly irritable and reports more anger than sadness when she is not understood. Rapid, repeated shifts between different affects within a short period (e.g., quick back-and-forth between crying and laughing) are not evident. The indications are insufficient for a definitive assessment.","There are no reports or observations that affective responses are excessively triggered by minor stimuli and then become uncontrollable (e.g., incessant crying or laughing against one's own will). Although euphoria appears increased, it is not clearly uncontrollable in the AMDP sense. A definitive assessment is not possible.","The affect is clearly lively, modulated, and appropriate to the situation within the context of an elevated mood (humor, anger, joy, self-irony). A reduced affective lability or rigid, poorly modulated affective state is not evident.","The patient explicitly reports high drive (""The drive is also working great""), minimal need for sleep (1–2 hours, which is ""completely"" sufficient for her), numerous activities and projects, as well as social activity. There are no indications of a lack of energy, initiative, or interest in terms of reduced drive.","The patient describes herself as full of energy, feels ""in great shape,"" and reports no slowing or blockage of drive, but rather the opposite; no indications of actions experienced as effortful with preserved intentionality.","Markedly increased energy and activity: feels ""super, super, super,"" needs ""no more sleep,"" only 1–2 hours are sufficient, many ideas and projects (well in the Sahara, large concert, sponsor acquisition), numerous activities (taxi to the Lüneburg Heath), conflicts with neighbors and family; significant impairments and hospital admission → severe increase in drive.","The text does not describe clear signs of undirected motor restlessness (e.g., aimless wandering, constant fidgeting, hand wringing); fiddling with the pocket and sweeping up crumbs appear purposeful. A definitive assessment is not possible.","There are no descriptions of qualitatively abnormal, stereotypically repeated movements or verbal/motor automatisms (e.g., echolalia, echopraxia, tics, catalepsy); no specific observations regarding these are reported.","Although the conversational style is lively and witty, there is no clear description of unnaturally ornate, affected, or group-unusually bizarre movements, gestures, or speech in the sense of the AMDP feature; therefore, a definitive assessment is not possible.","Excessively dramatic behavior during the conversation: presents herself as the master of ceremonies of a large concert, sings during the interview, repeatedly comments on her appearance (""how good that I washed my hair yesterday""), provides extensive show-like descriptions and repeatedly steers the conversation in this direction, making structuring difficult → moderately theatrical with noticeable but not maximal impairment.","The patient is extremely talkative, responds in detail and spontaneously, repeatedly takes over the direction of the conversation; no indication of poverty of speech or mutism.","Markedly increased speech flow: she speaks almost continuously, changes topics, the examiner repeatedly barely gets to ask questions and has to restructure the conversation several times; she could ""keep talking for a very long time"" → logorrheic speech with a clear disturbance of conversational control, thus severe.",There is no information on diurnal variation of symptom severity with a morning low; the remark about getting out of bed easily in the morning does not allow a definitive statement about the presence or absence of a systematic morning low.,"In the conversation, there are no indications of a regular evening dip or more pronounced evening symptoms; no specific information is provided regarding this.",There are no indications of diurnal fluctuations in the symptoms or a specific improvement in the evening.,"The patient describes numerous and active social contacts (new boyfriend, Tom's family, pastor, neighbors, fellow patients) and plans communal activities; no withdrawal from other people is evident.","There is a marked increase in social activities with increased initiation of contact (pastor during church service, sponsors/celebrities, fellow patients, new young friend) and a missionary demeanor, which is perceived as disturbing by others (pastor sends her away, conflicts with relatives, complaints from neighbors). This leads to significant interpersonal problems, but without reported serious external consequences such as police involvement or similar.","There are derogatory and hostile verbal expressions directed at family members (husband and daughter repeatedly referred to as ""stupid""/""dumb""), but no evidence of severe insults, threats, or physical violence. Therefore, only mild verbal aggressiveness is present.","The patient reports markedly good mood, joy of life, and numerous plans; there are no indications of death wishes, weariness of life, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal actions.",No self-harming or self-injurious behaviors without suicidal intent are described.,"Despite clearly pronounced manic symptoms and inpatient admission, the patient repeatedly emphasizes that she is ""doing great,"" feels ""fantastic,"" and does not understand why she is here; she perceives no illness in herself. This indicates a significant discrepancy between the objective severity of the disorder and the subjective experience of illness.","The patient does not acknowledge the mental illness, does not consider her ideas and behavior (e.g., well project, money transfers, sleep reduction) to be disease-related, and expresses significant doubts about the medical assessment (""They can be wrong too,"" ""Rather not,"" that the doctors are correct). This indicates a clearly lacking insight into the mental illness.","She is ""not at all"" agreeable to being in the clinic, does not want to ""stay here,"" sees no need for treatment, and refuses to take medication (""You have tried, but so far..."", ""I am fine""). Thus, she opposes an inpatient and pharmacological treatment that is medically necessary from a physician's perspective.","The patient appears competent in everyday matters during the conversation, independently organized (travel, money transfers, bringing documents), and reports no dependency on assistance in activities of daily living.","The patient is consistently awake, alert, responds promptly to verbal stimuli, and shows no signs of drowsiness, slowing, or decreased vigilance.","She is oriented to person, place, time, and situation, can meaningfully connect content and act purposefully (e.g., explains projects, biography, purpose of the recording); no global confusion or disorganization is evident.","Although she frequently returns to the topic of wells/Sahara, her experience is not limited to a single theme; on the contrary, it is broad and easily distractible; she responds widely to external stimuli and changes in topics.","She reports feeling ""in great shape,"" ""brilliant,"" ""fantastic,"" allegedly needing only 1–2 hours of sleep without fatigue, feeling young, particularly capable, and ""born for greater things,"" and experiences many ideas and inner activity; this corresponds to a subjectively increased clarity/intensity of experience with significant social and financial consequences.","Upon inquiry, she correctly states the day of the week and date (""Thursday, 6th, February, 25th,"" according to the examiner's confirmation); temporal orientation is preserved.",She knows that she is in the ZI in Mannheim; that she does not know the ward name immediately after admission is to be expected and is not an indication of a disturbance of local orientation.,"She recognizes that she is a patient in the hospital, describes the closed door and the fact that she is not allowed to leave, and is able to correctly state at the end that the conversation is being recorded for scientific/educational purposes.","She knows her age range (""I am approaching 70""), origin (Feudenheim near Mannheim), marital status, relatives (husband, daughter), and biographical details; no indications of disorientation regarding her own person.","She understands questions and tasks, interprets proverbs correctly in terms of content (""Lies have short legs"" = one does not get far when lying), and can grasp abstractly what is meant by the proverbs; no overly literal or incorrect interpretation.","There are slight attention problems: distractibility during tasks (naming months, conversational digressions), errors in reciting the months backward (omissions, incorrect order), and slight imprecision in the memory task (number 26 instead of 24), but overall still largely feasible performance.","In the standardized memory test with the three terms (""Oslo, 24, ashtray""), after a few minutes she recalls ""ashtray, Oslo, and 26,"" thus only two terms correctly and one number incorrectly, despite her own assessment of having a ""fantastic"" memory; this indicates a mild reduction in memory capacity.","She is correctly oriented in time and place (date, day of the week, location, clinic), reports no amnesia or long-term memory gaps, and recalls biographical as well as culturally related content; she denies memory problems, thus there is no indication of a long-term memory disorder.","There are no identifiable memory gaps filled with varying fabricated content; upon repeated inquiries (e.g., duration of knowing Tom), the information remains consistent.","She reports neither déjà-vu/jamais-vu experiences, flashbacks, intrusions, nor other memory distortions or intrusive memories; corresponding symptoms are not addressed.","She describes herself as full of energy, with many ideas and without a subjective feeling of slowed or blocked thinking; rather, she experienced acceleration rather than inhibition of thinking.","In conversation, there is a high speech and thought tempo with rapid topic changes; there are no prolonged response latencies or sluggish conversational flow, thus no indication of slowed thinking.","She repeatedly gets lost in many peripheral details (handbag, clothing, prominent singers, sailing), goes ""from the hundredth to the thousandth,"" and answers questions only with extensive digressions, while the overall content coherence is largely maintained; this significantly impairs the flow of conversation (moderately circumstantial thinking).","Despite numerous digressions, she repeatedly returns to a few dominant themes (fountain in the Sahara, her own special ""calling,"" relationship with Tom, donations/projects) and remains strongly attached to them content-wise; other topics are quickly related back to these, indicating a clear, though not complete, narrowing of the scope of thought.","Although she emphasizes individual words (""stupid,"" ""top, top, top"") repeatedly, this occurs in a contextually appropriate situational context as affective reinforcement and not as meaningless perseveration on previous responses outside the respective context.","She describes many ideas and projects as positive and enjoyable (""I am doing great,"" ""I have many ideas""), without reporting distressing, recurrent, and difficult-to-interrupt worries or guilt thoughts; no indication of distressing, ruminative brooding in the sense of the AMDP.","The patient describes having ""far too much on her mind"" and ""many ideas,"" with her head full of plans; she experiences this more as pleasurable rather than as a strongly distressing pressure, which suggests mild thought pressure.","The conversation is noticeably erratic: she frequently switches from the current topic to associations (bag, sailing, gifts, celebrities, fairy tales), does not complete trains of thought, and is easily distracted, without completely losing coherence – this corresponds to a moderate degree of flight of ideas.","Despite thematic digressions, she answers most questions appropriately in terms of content; there is no evidence of systematically answering without any connection despite clearly understanding the topic of the question.","The flow of speech is consistently fluent and lively, without reported or observed sudden interruptions of thought or speech without external cause.","Despite abrupt topic changes, the formal coherence of the statements remains comprehensible, sentence structure and logic are essentially intact; no disintegration into unconnected sentence or word fragments.",There are no conspicuous neologisms or idiosyncratic word usages; slips of the tongue appear situational and not as systematic neologisms.,"Slightly suspicious tendencies: she refuses to provide information (""I won't tell you,"" ""it's nobody's business"") and assumes that the doctor might share it further; however, there is no pronounced anxious-hostile relatedness.","She reports that she is feeling ""excellent"" physically, currently has ""absolutely nothing,"" and shows no signs of excessive health anxiety or anxious self-monitoring.","Upon inquiry, she explicitly reports that she does not experience anxiety; phobia-typical, object- or situation-bound fears or avoidance are not described.","No repetitive, intrusive thoughts experienced as nonsensical with internal resistance are described.",The statement contains no indications of compelling action impulses experienced against internal resistance with a compulsive character.,No repetitive actions experienced as excessive or nonsensical with compulsive character are described.,"There is no description of a diffuse atmosphere of alteration, threat, or special significance of the environment;

a specific inner unrest cannot be clearly derived from the material.","She does not expressively complain about her own suffering, does not cry, and does not lament; the style is rather cheerfully mocking than whining.","The patient consistently describes herself as special, born for higher purposes, capable, and attractive; derogatory self-descriptions such as ""stupid"" are situational and casual, and do not reflect a diminished self-esteem.","Markedly grandiose self-image (""I know... that I am special,"" ""born for greater things,"" ""fantastically"" capable, feels young and physically attractive, convinced of winning all tests), combined with feelings of superiority and massive overestimation of self (delusions of grandeur regarding well construction in the Sahara, organizing a Wembley concert, lack of insight into illness) and resulting in conflictual and harmful behaviors (giving away large sums of money, family conflicts, hospitalization).","When directly asked about misconduct and conflicts, she explicitly denies having done anything wrong (""No. Why should I have done something wrong?"");

occasional word repetitions are context-related and not qualitatively abnormal in the sense of parakinesias.","Although the content is partly unusual/grandiose, the manner of gestures, facial expressions, and speech does not appear affected, eccentric, or artificially stylized in the sense of the AMDP characteristic.","Markedly exaggerated, theatrical behavior: the patient stages herself, makes jokes, sings, plays with the situation (""I will be the master of ceremonies at Wembley Stadium""), emphasizes her uniqueness, and appears as if in front of an audience;

colors and sounds do not appear altered to her, but she reports only loss of interest and rumination.","Although she says ""I don't know myself that well,"" this is, in context, an understandable experience of change due to depression (previously active, now lacking drive) and not an experience of the self as foreign, unreal, or like another person in the sense of depersonalization.","Upon direct inquiry about thought reading or thought manipulation, she denies any such experiences; no indications that others have immediate access to her thoughts.","There are no reports of thoughts being taken away or ""withdrawn"" from outside; corresponding experiences of external influence are denied.","She does not report experiencing thoughts as made, inserted, or controlled;

The later described intense shame due to neglect and towards the grandchildren corresponds more to shame than to explicit feelings of guilt regarding norm violations.","The patient is persistently worried about not having enough money in the event of being placed in a nursing home (""I don't have that much money,"" ""if I have to go to a home, then"").

therefore, there are no affective reactions specifically associated with delusional themes.",The patient reports no delusional reference of external events or conversations to herself; rather withdrawal and avoidance of contact without delusional self-reference.,She explicitly denies ever having thought that others wish her harm or are persecuting her; no delusional ideas of threat or persecution are evident.,"There are no statements regarding partnership or infidelity; the topic is not addressed, therefore no assessment is possible.","When asked about feelings of guilt, the patient denies them (""No, I just did everything as well as I could""). The described shame about being careless and towards the grandchildren is understandable in content and not delusionally exaggerated.","She is worried that money might become tight in the nursing home (""I don't have that much money""), but does not describe an unshakable, reality-contradicting conviction of financial ruin; realistic future concerns, no delusion.","She reports hip pain and aging processes but denies significant anxiety about her physical condition (""rather not"") and shows no delusional conviction of being seriously ill.","There is no information regarding excessive overestimation of oneself or special powers/rights; the topic was not explicitly explored, therefore a definitive assessment is not possible.","Upon repeated inquiries about experiences of being followed, influenced, or other bizarre phenomena (""manipulating or reading thoughts,"" ""others wanting to harm you""), the patient denies these; her concerns about the future, home, and household are colored by depression but are understandable in content and not delusional.","In response to the question about sensory illusions, the patient denies such experiences; even when asked about altered perception outdoors, she only describes a loss of interest (""boring""), with no misrecognition of real objects.","She explicitly denies ever having heard voices (""Heard voices or seen ghosts? – No. I am not familiar with such things."").","In response to the inquiry about sensory illusions, she reports no non-verbal auditory hallucinations and states that she is not familiar with such experiences.","She denies seeing ""ghosts"" or other unusual visual phenomena in the context of sensory distortions; there is no evidence of visual hallucinations.","The patient explicitly denies ever having experienced sensory illusions, and there are no reports of tactile hallucinations or abnormal bodily sensations (coenesthesias).","Upon inquiry about sensory illusions, the patient denies such experiences; no spontaneous olfactory or gustatory hallucinations are reported.","In response to the question of whether the external world appears different, she describes only boredom and lack of joy, but no experience of unreality, strangeness, or alienation from the environment.","In response to the question about uncanny changes in her own body, she denies any; she only describes a feeling of change understandable within the context of depression, without depersonalization or experiencing her own self as unreal.",She explicitly denies ever having felt that others could read her thoughts or share in them.,There is no indication that thoughts are experienced as being taken away or sucked out; this phenomenon is neither inquired about nor mentioned.,She explicitly denies experiencing that others manipulate or read her thoughts; there are no indications of made or inserted thoughts.,"In the conversation, there are no statements indicating that feelings, actions, or bodily functions are experienced as being made from outside; this topic is not explicitly discussed.","The patient is fully oriented, answers questions coherently, can explain her situation and complaints, and does not exhibit a bewildered, helpless, or perplexed affect.","The patient reports that she has ""no mood at all,"" everything is ""gray, gray boring,"" watching TV and activities are no fun, she cannot enjoy nature or her grandchildren and feels ashamed because of this emotional emptiness; there is pronounced distress and significant impairment in daily life, which indicates a severe degree.","In the conversation, multiple affects are responsive (sadness, anxiety, shame, guilt); a clearly restricted affective range is not evident.","The patient describes pronounced weakness and exhaustion (""I have no strength,"" ""I can't go on""), mostly remains lying on the sofa, and can barely manage household tasks and self-care.","Persistently negatively toned mood with statements such as ""went really badly,"" ""I have no mood at all,"" ""everything gray, gray boring,"" marked loss of interest, social withdrawal, and suicidal thoughts.","Markedly pessimistic future expectations with constant rumination (""what will become of me,"" fear of nursing home, feeling overwhelmed), but still some residual hope through trust in the general practitioner (""it could get better,"" ""somehow I do believe it"").","Severe, persistent fears about the future, institutionalization, and financial situation, described by the patient as constantly present and rated 7/10 on an anxiety scale, with thoughts hardly separable from the anxiety.","There is no evidence of excessive well-being, unusual cheerfulness, or unrealistic optimism.","No persistently sullen, nagging, or grumbling mood described; the statements are depressive-anxious and self-deprecating, not primarily irritable.","The patient reports that the loud grandchildren ""get on her nerves"" and that she occasionally reacts irritably (""can happen sometimes""), without indications of frequent or severe outbursts.","In addition to emptiness, she describes a marked inner restlessness (""sometimes I feel like I am about to burst""), associated with intense tension and incessant rumination, but without pronounced motor agitation.","The transcript does reveal complaints about the situation, but no sufficient evidence of exaggeratedly expressive lamentation (e.g., persistent sighing, moaning, theatrical facial expressions/gestures).","The patient describes a pronounced experience of personal inability and worthlessness in the area of performance: ""I simply couldn't go on,"" ""I have no strength,"" ""I can't manage anything anymore,"" ""I can no longer take care of myself,"" ""the household is all, all nothing. I can't cook anymore."" This leads to severe distress and significant impairments in daily life (fear of admission to a nursing home).","Consistently negative self-image, no indications of increased self-esteem or feelings of superiority; on the contrary, pronounced self-devaluation and helplessness.","Upon direct inquiry about feelings of guilt, the patient denies them (""No, I just did everything as well as I could""). Later, she clearly describes shame (""I really feel ashamed""), which according to AMDP is to be distinguished from feelings of guilt.","The patient is concerned about not being able to finance her living expenses in a nursing home in the future (""If I can no longer manage that... I have to go to a nursing home. I don't have that much money,"" ""Ha, if I have to go to a nursing home, then yes. Now it's okay""). There is a distressing fear of the future regarding financial resources, but currently no severe existential fear of impoverishment.","No clear description of simultaneously experienced, clearly contradictory feelings or action impulses in the sense of ambivalence/ambitendency.","The transcript contains no indications of an obviously inappropriate emotional expression in relation to the respective conversation content; moreover, a systematic external observation of facial expressions/gestures is lacking.",No rapid changes of different affects are described; the mood appears rather uniformly depressive without rapid affective shifts.,"There are no reports of affective outbursts (e.g., uncontrollable crying, incessant laughter, uncontrollable rage) that begin with minimal provocation and then become uncontrollable.","Although the patient subjectively describes ""everything as gray, gray and boring,"" there are no sufficient external observations indicating reduced affective modulation ability (restricted range of emotional expression).","The patient reports a pronounced lack of energy and initiative: ""I have no strength,"" ""It just doesn't work,"" ""I prefer to stay on the sofa,"" ""I can no longer go shopping,"" ""I can no longer cook,"" ""everything is neglected,"" ""I can no longer take care of myself."" She hardly leaves the apartment, withdraws socially, and is severely impaired in daily life, corresponding to severe avolition.","The patient reports a pronounced experience of being slowed down and lack of strength: ""I simply couldn't anymore,"" ""I have no strength,"" ""That means even getting oneself together doesn't really work"" – ""Doesn't work at all,"" ""The energy is gone,"" household tasks, cooking, and shopping ""no longer possible at all.""

no indications of disorientation to place.,"She understands that she is a patient in the ZI, a psychiatric examination is taking place, and medications/injections are used to treat the voices; there is no indication of misperceiving the current situation.","She knows her name, age (69 years), living situation, previous occupation, and family situation; although she refuses to provide her date of birth, she shows no disorientation regarding her own person.","Proverbs (""don't look a gift horse in the mouth,"" ""the apple doesn't fall far from the tree"") are interpreted in a markedly concrete and factually incorrect manner (brushing teeth, eating more applesauce, apple in the meadow); the abstract/metaphorical meaning is not understood even after explanation – clear comprehension disorder.","In the test (series 7 out of 100), she quickly loses track, makes calculation errors, and abandons the task; reports slow thought flow and shows slight difficulties in remembering/retrieving three terms – indications of moderately impaired attention and concentration ability.","In the 3-word test, the patient is unable to spontaneously recall any of the terms after some time, requires multiple cues (city, number, object), and even then recalls the number incorrectly or uncertainly; this indicates a significant impairment in the ability to retain new information.","There are no clear indications of persistent long-term memory impairments (for example, she knows her address, age, previous occupation, and past treatments); no specific memory gaps for past events are reported, therefore there is insufficient information.","Despite bizarre, delusionally colored statements, there are no changing, mutually contradictory answers regarding the same matter in the sense of confabulations; the content is consistently delusional, not to fill memory gaps.","Neither déjà vu/jamais vu experiences, flashbacks, intrusions, hypermnesias, nor other memory distortions in the sense of paramnesias are described; specific information on this is lacking.","Upon inquiry, the patient currently describes her thinking as ""rather a bit too slow,"" which corresponds to a subjectively experienced inhibition of thought, without a marked impairment or high level of distress being evident.","The transcript does not reveal any clearly prolonged response latencies beyond reflective thinking or a consistently sluggish conversational flow; therefore, a reliable external assessment is not possible.","The patient usually responds briefly and addresses the questions asked directly; there is no evidence of systematic fixation on trivial details while maintaining goal-directedness, as would be seen in circumstantial, rambling thinking.","The patient repeatedly returns in conversation to a few consistent topics (God, those ""fallen out"" from the Vatican, power outlets, voices, Haribo) and is clearly fixated on this delusional-hallucinatory reference system in terms of content, but can still engage with other topics upon exploration, which indicates a mild narrowing of thought content.","Although individual words or phrases are repeated for emphasis (""I'm not saying it,"" etc.), there are no automatic, contextually meaningless repetitions of previous responses or words in the sense of perseverations.",The patient does not report that her thoughts tormentingly revolve fruitlessly around certain content; the described delusional fears and auditory phenomena do not clearly meet the criteria of thought rumination subjectively experienced as brooding.,"The patient describes rather slowed thinking (""at the moment it is somewhat too slow"") and phases of thought emptiness/""blank,"" but nowhere a pressure of many intrusive thoughts. This argues against thought pressure.","The course of the conversation is essentially organized, with responses remaining on the respective question; there are no typical, associatively driven topic shifts in the sense of ""jumping from one subject to another."" Additionally, the patient reports slow, not accelerated thoughts. Therefore, there is no indication of flight of ideas.","The patient responds to the questions in a coherent manner (e.g., regarding voices, apartment, tasks, proverbs). There is no evidence of a systematic response that understands the question but is completely irrelevant in content.","The patient repeatedly describes sudden episodes of thought blanking (""as if a piece of the brain were removed,"" ""black hole,"" thoughts being taken away) and loses the thread during conversation (""now I have lost the thread""). This corresponds to thought blocking with significant impairment, but not continuously, therefore moderate in severity.","Despite bizarre delusional content, the flow of speech remains largely logically comprehensible, sentence structure is preserved, and the train of thought is understandable over extended passages. There is no disintegration of speech coherence in the sense of incoherence or fragmentation.","The patient repeatedly uses idiosyncratic, unconventional word formations such as ""verscharmüpseln,"" ""verballmützeln,"" ""Vorbeilhörneln,"" ""verschmudeln,"" and ""ringbeißen"" to describe the actions of the voices. However, the overall context remains understandable and only slightly impaired, thus indicating a mild severity.","She experiences the landlord, the janitor, and a specific group (""fallen from God out of the Vatican"") as persecutory persons who monitor her via power outlets/microphones, suspects that the homeowner belongs to this group, and was initially also reserved towards the examiner (""I won't tell""). This pronounced, hostile-anxious relatedness leads to significant impairment (sleep deprivation, defensive actions, failure to collect the depot injection), therefore severe.","There are no statements regarding body-related fears, excessive worry about illnesses, or anxious-concerned monitoring of bodily functions. The described experiences primarily concern voices, persecution, and thought manipulation, not fears of illness. Therefore, there is insufficient information for hypochondria.","Upon direct inquiry about specific fears (e.g., spiders, heights), the patient denies (""No. I am not afraid... not of spiders or anything like that.""). There is no evidence of situation- or object-bound fears recognized as excessive, with avoidance behavior.","The patient reports no repetitive, intrusive own thoughts experienced as nonsensical against internal resistance. The Bible tapping and the purchase of certain sweets are based on commands from voices or a divine mission and are experienced not as nonsensical but as meaningful protection. This corresponds to delusional experience/behavior, not obsessive thoughts.","The described calls to action (e.g., buying sweets, cooking semolina pudding, washing hair) are clearly experienced as imperative voices or external influences, not as one's own impulses recognized as nonsensical and occurring against internal resistance.","Actions such as striking the Bible, covering electrical outlets with tape, rearranging furniture, and tapping on walls are experienced as meaningful defensive behaviors within the context of the delusion, not as rituals recognized as senseless and repetitively performed against internal resistance.","Well-formed delusional content is described, but no diffuse, indefinite expectation or uncanny mood preceding a delusion; no usable information is available regarding this.","Perceptions that are essentially correct acquire delusional self-referential significance, for example, statements by a television presenter are understood as special ""signs"" for the patient. These experiences are embedded in a pronounced delusional reference system and lead to significant impairment (inpatient treatment, marked disruption of daily functioning).","The reported delusional experiences (mission from God, being chosen, etc.) are linked to voices or apparitions and thus to perceptions; a delusional idea occurring spontaneously without any perceptible cause is not clearly described.","There have been fixed delusional systems for many years: ""fallen from God out of the Vatican"" are persecuting her, have installed bugs/microphones, read and steal thoughts, implant thoughts (Haribo), she is chosen (""Gebennedeite,"" ""Durchleuchtete"") with a divine mission. These convictions are persistent, uncorrectable, and lead to severe social and functional impairment (insomnia, police involvement, repeated hospitalizations).","The individual delusional elements are closely linked: fallen Vatican priests, God as the client, homeowner/caretaker as an accomplice, installation of bugs and socket listening devices, thought withdrawal and implantation, cards and devotional books as means of communication or protection. This results in a largely developed, logically-paralogically structured ""story"" with few gaps.","The patient reports her pronounced persecutory and influence delusions with noticeable affective involvement (insomnia, staying awake due to fear of thought theft, previous panic flight naked from the apartment), but describes the current anxiety as ""it's actually okay"" and appears at times neutral to slightly tense during the conversation. The affective involvement is thus clear but not extreme.","Relational aspects (e.g., a TV presenter as a ""sign,"" constant preoccupation of the persecutors with her) occur primarily within the context of a comprehensive persecution and influence delusion; an isolated relational delusion in the sense of the AMDP is not present, and the relational aspect is part of the persecution delusion (feature 40).","The patient clearly perceives herself as the target of hostile actions: a group ""fallen from God from the Vatican"" as well as landlords/caretakers monitor her, break into her apartment, bug the walls, eavesdrop on her through electrical outlets, insult her, steal and manipulate thoughts, and want to prevent her from reporting this or leaving the apartment. This leads to significant impairment (severe sleep disturbance, defensive actions up to police intervention, social impoverishment, repeated inpatient treatments).","No statements regarding partnership or infidelity ideas; no indication of delusional jealousy, but the topic was not specifically explored.",No statements regarding unforgivable errors or exaggerated/delusional guilt; the topic of guilt is not evidently addressed.,Financial concerns or notions of impending ruin are not addressed; insufficient information.,"Description of a ""hole in the brain"" in the context of experiencing external influence, but no delusional conviction of suffering from a severe illness; hypochondriacal delusion not assessable.","The patient perceives herself as directly chosen by God (""illuminated,"" ""blessed"") with special powers (transmitting thoughts to others, reading thoughts), which represents a delusional self-aggrandizement; significant impairment experienced, but not primarily distressing.","Pronounced systematic persecutory and religious delusions (Vatican priests fallen away from God, bugs/microphones in the apartment, janitor/landlord as conspirators, divine mission to expose them), associated with severe impairments in daily functioning, sleep disturbances, police involvement, and repeated hospital admissions.","No misinterpretation of real stimuli described; perceptual changes (""duller,"" ""like uncleaned glasses"") without reinterpreting real objects, instead genuine hallucinations.","Persistent hearing of male voices without an external source, especially from power outlets (""they speak to me,"" ""say nothing""), sometimes choral in nature, with commenting and imperative content (e.g., commands to eat, prohibitions on speaking), currently present during conversation; significant distress with insomnia, protective rituals, and relevant behavioral control.","Only articulated voices are described; no non-speech sounds (clanging, hissing, orchestra, etc.) without a stimulus source are reported.","No reports of visual perceptions without a stimulus source; only a description of a generally ""dull,"" grayer environment, which does not constitute a visual hallucination.","In the interview, there are no indications of tactile hallucinations or bizarre bodily sensations; the symptom was not specifically explored.",No spontaneous or on-demand reported perceptions of smell or taste without a stimulus source are described; the topic is not directly addressed.,"The patient reports that reality has recently been ""a bit duller,"" ""as if the glasses are not cleaned,"" corners and ceilings have ""shrunk,"" and everything is somewhat gray; this corresponds to a mild experience of derealization with only a slight degree of distress.","There are no indications that she experiences herself, her body, or her person as foreign or unreal; this symptom is not specifically inquired about.","She describes that she can let thoughts ""come out from the front"" of her head, ""project"" them onto others so that they enter the minds of others and control their actions; this corresponds to an experience of the spreading of her own thoughts, without a significant level of distress being evident.","The patient describes it as ""like a piece of the brain being removed"" and then there is a ""black hole""; others have ""taken out"" her brain with their thoughts. This experience is accompanied by cognitive impairment and insecurity, indicating a moderate severity level.","She reports that thoughts are ""shot"" and ""implanted"" into her brain by the group like a ""swimming cap with little things"" (e.g., buying Haribo, cooking semolina pudding, no longer getting depot injections); she experiences these thoughts as not her own and follows them with relevant negative consequences (therapy discontinuation, eating behavior), which indicates a severe level of severity.","She experiences that those fallen from the Vatican are ""listening in"" on her through electrical outlets, ""setting her loose,"" and controlling her behavior (e.g., not leaving the apartment, buying sweets, performing certain actions); she is sometimes unable to resist this and develops defensive actions (hitting the Bible), which indicates moderate experiences of external influence.","The transcript does not provide clear indications of an affective impression of perplexity (astonished-helpless, ""does not know what is going on""); nonverbal signs are not assessable.","Upon inquiry, she describes her mood as ""neither,"" rather neutral, without complaints of inner emptiness, coldness, or lack of ability to feel; there are no indications of a subjective feeling of numbness.","During the interview, various affects are observed (neutrality, slight anxiety, humor); no indication of a significantly reduced affective range.","There are no statements regarding general weakness, fatigability, or reduced sense of well-being; information on this is lacking.","The patient describes her mood as neither sad nor happy, rather neutral; no reports of depression or pronounced worries.",She expresses hope that the voices will improve again; a persistently pessimistic outlook on the future is not described.,"She reports sometimes feeling anxious and then staying awake to ""be alert,"" but emphasizes that she ""actually manages"" with the anxiety; this indicates mild, situationally bound anxiety.",No phases of increased well-being or unusual cheerfulness are described; current mood rather neutral.,"She does not appear particularly sullen, complaining, or persistently in a bad mood during the conversation; corresponding statements are absent.",Neither rapid anger reactions nor aggressive outbursts or tense irritability are described or evident.,"Although sleep disturbances and wakefulness are reported, no subjective experience of inner nervousness or feeling driven is described; information on inner restlessness is lacking.","The patient reports her complaints in a relatively matter-of-fact manner; exaggerated lamenting with sighing, moaning, or prolonged complaining is not evident.",There are no statements regarding reduced self-esteem or experienced personal inability; the topic is not addressed directly.,"The patient reports delusionally that she has been chosen by God, ""the Illuminated,"" ""the Blessed,"" has a special mission, and can transmit thoughts to others and read thoughts, which clearly reflects an increased experience of self-worth and special abilities; however, she remains partially structured in everyday practical matters.",No subjective feelings of guilt or conscience are described; corresponding content is not addressed.,There are no statements regarding experienced (imminent) material deprivation or concern about financial resources.,"She simultaneously expresses trust and mistrust towards the caregiver (""I do trust her. Mostly,"" ""although, sometimes I am also a bit... but. I have to trust someone""), which suggests a certain simultaneous emotional ambivalence without marked impairment.",The transcript does not reveal any clearly inappropriate emotional expression in relation to the respective conversation content; a comparison of facial/gestural affect is not possible.,A rapid shift of various affects is neither reported by the patient nor described in the dialogue.,"There is no evidence of excessive affective outbursts triggered by minor stimuli and subsequently uncontrollable (e.g., uncontrollable crying or laughing).",No reliable observational data regarding the modulation capacity of affect (range of fluctuation) are available from the interview.,"The patient reports activities (cooking, shopping, moving furniture, walking with a rollator);

only general sleep disturbances and a slight improvement since admission to the ward are described.,"She lives alone, reports that she hardly has any acquaintances or friends (""not really""), and states that she essentially only interacts with her caregiver;

on the contrary, there is a marked lack of social contact.",Neither verbal nor physical aggression against persons or targeted property damage with hostile intent is reported; the hammering on walls serves the search for supposed bugs and is not described as aggressive behavior.,"She denies any intention to harm herself and emphasizes that she ""is not allowed to,"" as her caregiver stated; no wishes for death, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions are described.",An injury to the hand while hammering is described as unintentional/clumsy; there is no evidence of intentional self-harm for self-injury or tension reduction.,"She experiences the voices and sleep deprivation as distressing, repeatedly seeks inpatient help, and recognizes that the medication makes the voices quieter and facilitates following the commands; thus, she feels significantly in need of treatment and not completely healthy.","She consistently attributes her voices and persecution to a godless group (""fallen from God in the Vatican""), hidden microphones/bugs, and a divine mission, and perceives herself as ""blessed"" and chosen; the symptoms are not understood as expressions of a mental illness, despite years of treatment, so that almost all complaints are attributed to a delusional explanatory model.","She reports that, at the voices' urging, she has not gone for the depot injection for about eight weeks (""then I thought, well, I won't go anymore""), after which the symptomatology rapidly worsened; thus, a medically necessary treatment was clearly refused.","Although she lives alone and can still cook and shop, she uses a rollator and regularly receives meals on wheels; this indicates a certain, rather mild level of support with daily activities, without comprehensive care dependency.","The patient is consistently awake, well responsive, and engages in an extended structured conversation without signs of dizziness or drowsiness.","Despite pronounced psychotic symptoms, the patient understands the situation and roles (clinic, examination, caregiver), can report coherently, and act purposefully;

therefore, a reliable external assessment is not possible.","The patient usually responds briefly and addresses the questions asked directly; there is no evidence of systematic fixation on trivial details while maintaining goal-directedness, as would be seen in circumstantial, rambling thinking.","The patient repeatedly returns in conversation to a few consistent topics (God, those ""fallen out"" from the Vatican, power outlets, voices, Haribo) and is clearly fixated on this delusional-hallucinatory reference system in terms of content, but can still engage with other topics upon exploration, which indicates a mild narrowing of thought content.","Although individual words or phrases are repeated for emphasis (""I'm not saying it,"" etc.), there are no automatic, contextually meaningless repetitions of previous responses or words in the sense of perseverations.",The patient does not report that her thoughts tormentingly revolve fruitlessly around certain content; the described delusional fears and auditory phenomena do not clearly meet the criteria of thought rumination subjectively experienced as brooding.,"The patient describes rather slowed thinking (""at the moment it is somewhat too slow"") and phases of thought emptiness/""blank,"" but nowhere a pressure of many intrusive thoughts. This argues against thought pressure.","The course of the conversation is essentially organized, with responses remaining on the respective question; there are no typical, associatively driven topic shifts in the sense of ""jumping from one subject to another."" Additionally, the patient reports slow, not accelerated thoughts. Therefore, there is no indication of flight of ideas.","The patient responds to the questions in a coherent manner (e.g., regarding voices, apartment, tasks, proverbs). There is no evidence of a systematic response that understands the question but is completely irrelevant in content.","The patient repeatedly describes sudden episodes of thought blanking (""as if a piece of the brain were removed,"" ""black hole,"" thoughts being taken away) and loses the thread during conversation (""now I have lost the thread""). This corresponds to thought blocking with significant impairment, but not continuously, therefore moderate in severity.","Despite bizarre delusional content, the flow of speech remains largely logically comprehensible, sentence structure is preserved, and the train of thought is understandable over extended passages. There is no disintegration of speech coherence in the sense of incoherence or fragmentation.","The patient repeatedly uses idiosyncratic, unconventional word formations such as ""verscharmüpseln,"" ""verballmützeln,"" ""Vorbeilhörneln,"" ""verschmudeln,"" and ""ringbeißen"" to describe the actions of the voices. However, the overall context remains understandable and only slightly impaired, thus indicating a mild severity.","She experiences the landlord, the janitor, and a specific group (""fallen from God out of the Vatican"") as persecutory persons who monitor her via power outlets/microphones, suspects that the homeowner belongs to this group, and was initially also reserved towards the examiner (""I won't tell""). This pronounced, hostile-anxious relatedness leads to significant impairment (sleep deprivation, defensive actions, failure to collect the depot injection), therefore severe.","There are no statements regarding body-related fears, excessive worry about illnesses, or anxious-concerned monitoring of bodily functions. The described experiences primarily concern voices, persecution, and thought manipulation, not fears of illness. Therefore, there is insufficient information for hypochondria.","Upon direct inquiry about specific fears (e.g., spiders, heights), the patient denies (""No. I am not afraid... not of spiders or anything like that.""). There is no evidence of situation- or object-bound fears recognized as excessive, with avoidance behavior.","The patient reports no repetitive, intrusive own thoughts experienced as nonsensical against internal resistance. The Bible tapping and the purchase of certain sweets are based on commands from voices or a divine mission and are experienced not as nonsensical but as meaningful protection. This corresponds to delusional experience/behavior, not obsessive thoughts.","The described calls to action (e.g., buying sweets, cooking semolina pudding, washing hair) are clearly experienced as imperative voices or external influences, not as one's own impulses recognized as nonsensical and occurring against internal resistance.","Actions such as striking the Bible, covering electrical outlets with tape, rearranging furniture, and tapping on walls are experienced as meaningful defensive behaviors within the context of the delusion, not as rituals recognized as senseless and repetitively performed against internal resistance.","Well-formed delusional content is described, but no diffuse, indefinite expectation or uncanny mood preceding a delusion; no usable information is available regarding this.","Perceptions that are essentially correct acquire delusional self-referential significance, for example, statements by a television presenter are understood as special ""signs"" for the patient. These experiences are embedded in a pronounced delusional reference system and lead to significant impairment (inpatient treatment, marked disruption of daily functioning).","The reported delusional experiences (mission from God, being chosen, etc.) are linked to voices or apparitions and thus to perceptions; a delusional idea occurring spontaneously without any perceptible cause is not clearly described.","There have been fixed delusional systems for many years: ""fallen from God out of the Vatican"" are persecuting her, have installed bugs/microphones, read and steal thoughts, implant thoughts (Haribo), she is chosen (""Gebennedeite,"" ""Durchleuchtete"") with a divine mission. These convictions are persistent, uncorrectable, and lead to severe social and functional impairment (insomnia, police involvement, repeated hospitalizations).","The individual delusional elements are closely linked: fallen Vatican priests, God as the client, homeowner/caretaker as an accomplice, installation of bugs and socket listening devices, thought withdrawal and implantation, cards and devotional books as means of communication or protection. This results in a largely developed, logically-paralogically structured ""story"" with few gaps.","The patient reports her pronounced persecutory and influence delusions with noticeable affective involvement (insomnia, staying awake due to fear of thought theft, previous panic flight naked from the apartment), but describes the current anxiety as ""it's actually okay"" and appears at times neutral to slightly tense during the conversation. The affective involvement is thus clear but not extreme.","Relational aspects (e.g., a TV presenter as a ""sign,"" constant preoccupation of the persecutors with her) occur primarily within the context of a comprehensive persecution and influence delusion; an isolated relational delusion in the sense of the AMDP is not present, and the relational aspect is part of the persecution delusion (feature 40).","The patient clearly perceives herself as the target of hostile actions: a group ""fallen from God from the Vatican"" as well as landlords/caretakers monitor her, break into her apartment, bug the walls, eavesdrop on her through electrical outlets, insult her, steal and manipulate thoughts, and want to prevent her from reporting this or leaving the apartment. This leads to significant impairment (severe sleep disturbance, defensive actions up to police intervention, social impoverishment, repeated inpatient treatments).","No statements regarding partnership or infidelity ideas; no indication of delusional jealousy, but the topic was not specifically explored.",No statements regarding unforgivable errors or exaggerated/delusional guilt; the topic of guilt is not evidently addressed.,Financial concerns or notions of impending ruin are not addressed; insufficient information.,"Description of a ""hole in the brain"" in the context of experiencing external influence, but no delusional conviction of suffering from a severe illness; hypochondriacal delusion not assessable.","The patient perceives herself as directly chosen by God (""illuminated,"" ""blessed"") with special powers (transmitting thoughts to others, reading thoughts), which represents a delusional self-aggrandizement; significant impairment experienced, but not primarily distressing.","Pronounced systematic persecutory and religious delusions (Vatican priests fallen away from God, bugs/microphones in the apartment, janitor/landlord as conspirators, divine mission to expose them), associated with severe impairments in daily functioning, sleep disturbances, police involvement, and repeated hospital admissions.","No misinterpretation of real stimuli described; perceptual changes (""duller,"" ""like uncleaned glasses"") without reinterpreting real objects, instead genuine hallucinations.","Persistent hearing of male voices without an external source, especially from power outlets (""they speak to me,"" ""say nothing""), sometimes choral in nature, with commenting and imperative content (e.g., commands to eat, prohibitions on speaking), currently present during conversation; significant distress with insomnia, protective rituals, and relevant behavioral control.","Only articulated voices are described; no non-speech sounds (clanging, hissing, orchestra, etc.) without a stimulus source are reported.","No reports of visual perceptions without a stimulus source; only a description of a generally ""dull,"" grayer environment, which does not constitute a visual hallucination.","In the interview, there are no indications of tactile hallucinations or bizarre bodily sensations; the symptom was not specifically explored.",No spontaneous or on-demand reported perceptions of smell or taste without a stimulus source are described; the topic is not directly addressed.,"The patient reports that reality has recently been ""a bit duller,"" ""as if the glasses are not cleaned,"" corners and ceilings have ""shrunk,"" and everything is somewhat gray; this corresponds to a mild experience of derealization with only a slight degree of distress.","There are no indications that she experiences herself, her body, or her person as foreign or unreal; this symptom is not specifically inquired about.","She describes that she can let thoughts ""come out from the front"" of her head, ""project"" them onto others so that they enter the minds of others and control their actions; this corresponds to an experience of the spreading of her own thoughts, without a significant level of distress being evident.","The patient describes it as ""like a piece of the brain being removed"" and then there is a ""black hole""; others have ""taken out"" her brain with their thoughts. This experience is accompanied by cognitive impairment and insecurity, indicating a moderate severity level.","She reports that thoughts are ""shot"" and ""implanted"" into her brain by the group like a ""swimming cap with little things"" (e.g., buying Haribo, cooking semolina pudding, no longer getting depot injections); she experiences these thoughts as not her own and follows them with relevant negative consequences (therapy discontinuation, eating behavior), which indicates a severe level of severity.","She experiences that those fallen from the Vatican are ""listening in"" on her through electrical outlets, ""setting her loose,"" and controlling her behavior (e.g., not leaving the apartment, buying sweets, performing certain actions); she is sometimes unable to resist this and develops defensive actions (hitting the Bible), which indicates moderate experiences of external influence.","The transcript does not provide clear indications of an affective impression of perplexity (astonished-helpless, ""does not know what is going on""); nonverbal signs are not assessable.","Upon inquiry, she describes her mood as ""neither,"" rather neutral, without complaints of inner emptiness, coldness, or lack of ability to feel; there are no indications of a subjective feeling of numbness.","During the interview, various affects are observed (neutrality, slight anxiety, humor); no indication of a significantly reduced affective range.","There are no statements regarding general weakness, fatigability, or reduced sense of well-being; information on this is lacking.","The patient describes her mood as neither sad nor happy, rather neutral; no reports of depression or pronounced worries.",She expresses hope that the voices will improve again; a persistently pessimistic outlook on the future is not described.,"She reports sometimes feeling anxious and then staying awake to ""be alert,"" but emphasizes that she ""actually manages"" with the anxiety; this indicates mild, situationally bound anxiety.",No phases of increased well-being or unusual cheerfulness are described; current mood rather neutral.,"She does not appear particularly sullen, complaining, or persistently in a bad mood during the conversation; corresponding statements are absent.",Neither rapid anger reactions nor aggressive outbursts or tense irritability are described or evident.,"Although sleep disturbances and wakefulness are reported, no subjective experience of inner nervousness or feeling driven is described; information on inner restlessness is lacking.","The patient reports her complaints in a relatively matter-of-fact manner; exaggerated lamenting with sighing, moaning, or prolonged complaining is not evident.",There are no statements regarding reduced self-esteem or experienced personal inability; the topic is not addressed directly.,"The patient reports delusionally that she has been chosen by God, ""the Illuminated,"" ""the Blessed,"" has a special mission, and can transmit thoughts to others and read thoughts, which clearly reflects an increased experience of self-worth and special abilities; however, she remains partially structured in everyday practical matters.",No subjective feelings of guilt or conscience are described; corresponding content is not addressed.,There are no statements regarding experienced (imminent) material deprivation or concern about financial resources.,"She simultaneously expresses trust and mistrust towards the caregiver (""I do trust her. Mostly,"" ""although, sometimes I am also a bit... but. I have to trust someone""), which suggests a certain simultaneous emotional ambivalence without marked impairment.",The transcript does not reveal any clearly inappropriate emotional expression in relation to the respective conversation content; a comparison of facial/gestural affect is not possible.,A rapid shift of various affects is neither reported by the patient nor described in the dialogue.,"There is no evidence of excessive affective outbursts triggered by minor stimuli and subsequently uncontrollable (e.g., uncontrollable crying or laughing).",No reliable observational data regarding the modulation capacity of affect (range of fluctuation) are available from the interview.,"The patient reports activities (cooking, shopping, moving furniture, walking with a rollator); a subjective lack of energy, initiative, or interest is not described and was not explored.","In conversation, no explicit statements about inhibited or blocked energy/initiative; only a reference to slow thoughts, not to subjectively experienced drive inhibition.","There are no clear self-reports or reports from others indicating increased energy, initiative, or increased goal-directed activities compared to the usual state; nocturnal wakefulness is rather described as vigilance due to hearing voices.","In the present transcript, there is no description of increased, undirected motor activity (e.g., pacing, fidgeting, rocking).","No evidence of stereotypies, echolalia, echopraxia, tic-like movements, or other qualitatively abnormal movements documented during the course of the conversation.","Although the content statements are delusional-bizarre, there is no description of conspicuously artificial, ornate, or stylized motor activity/speech in the sense of the AMDP feature.",The presentation does not appear exaggerated or theatrical in the transcript; no indications of aggravating or performance-like behavior for an audience are described.,"The patient speaks spontaneously, responds in a detailed and coherent manner; no poverty of speech or refusal to speak, on the contrary, active participation in the conversation.","No indication that the patient permanently dominates the flow of conversation, is difficult to interrupt, or exhibits a significantly increased rate of speech; responses are mostly given in response to questions.","Poor sleep is reported, but no consistent worsening of symptoms specifically in the morning is mentioned.",The material contains no information indicating a regular worsening of symptoms in the evening.,There are no indications of a consistent improvement of symptoms in the evening; only general sleep disturbances and a slight improvement since admission to the ward are described.,"She lives alone, reports that she hardly has any acquaintances or friends (""not really""), and states that she essentially only interacts with her caregiver; this corresponds to a significant withdrawal from social contacts with a certain level of distress (""otherwise I am completely alone"").","There is no evidence of an increase in social activities or intrusive contact behavior; on the contrary, there is a marked lack of social contact.",Neither verbal nor physical aggression against persons or targeted property damage with hostile intent is reported; the hammering on walls serves the search for supposed bugs and is not described as aggressive behavior.,"She denies any intention to harm herself and emphasizes that she ""is not allowed to,"" as her caregiver stated; no wishes for death, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions are described.",An injury to the hand while hammering is described as unintentional/clumsy; there is no evidence of intentional self-harm for self-injury or tension reduction.,"She experiences the voices and sleep deprivation as distressing, repeatedly seeks inpatient help, and recognizes that the medication makes the voices quieter and facilitates following the commands; thus, she feels significantly in need of treatment and not completely healthy.","She consistently attributes her voices and persecution to a godless group (""fallen from God in the Vatican""), hidden microphones/bugs, and a divine mission, and perceives herself as ""blessed"" and chosen; the symptoms are not understood as expressions of a mental illness, despite years of treatment, so that almost all complaints are attributed to a delusional explanatory model.","She reports that, at the voices' urging, she has not gone for the depot injection for about eight weeks (""then I thought, well, I won't go anymore""), after which the symptomatology rapidly worsened; thus, a medically necessary treatment was clearly refused.","Although she lives alone and can still cook and shop, she uses a rollator and regularly receives meals on wheels; this indicates a certain, rather mild level of support with daily activities, without comprehensive care dependency."

there are no signs of globally impaired clarity of consciousness as seen in delirium.","The experience clearly revolves around voices, God, fallen Vatican figures, and power outlets; nevertheless, the patient is receptive to other topics (biography, daily life, tests, treatment); the thematic narrowing is present but can be easily overcome during conversation.","No experiences of particular clarity, intensification, or expansion of consciousness are reported; on the contrary, she describes reality as ""duller"" and ""gray.""","The patient reports that she has ""somewhat lost track of time"" and is uncertain whether events occurred two or three days ago and how long she has been on the ward; this indicates a slight uncertainty in the current temporal orientation.","She can correctly state her address (""Jungbuschstraße 3"") and current location (ZI, ward) and reports a long-term stay there; no indications of uncertainty regarding the location.","She understands that as a patient in the ZI ward, an admission/examination interview is being conducted and recorded, and she repeatedly correctly refers to previous stays; no situational misinterpretation.","She states her name, age (69 years), and address, reports coherently about her family, professional biography, and living conditions; no uncertainty regarding autobiographical basic data.","In the proverb test, idiomatic expressions are interpreted in a markedly concrete and meaning-distorting manner (""gift horse..."" = brushing teeth; ""apple does not fall far from the tree"" = eat more applesauce/apple lies in the meadow), and the figurative meaning is not understood even after explanation; additionally, there are comprehension difficulties with more abstract questions, despite overall preserved everyday communication.","In the Serial-7 test, she quickly loses track, makes calculation errors, focuses on formal aspects (""70, there is a 7 in it""), and aborts the task with ""I can't do it anymore""; additionally, she reports forgetting content and describes her thought process as ""too slow,"" indicating a moderately impaired sustained attention performance.","In the 3-word recall test, she is unable to freely recall any of the terms after a time interval, confuses the number (32/34/43), and requires clear cues (""Oslo,"" ""ashtray"") to partially reproduce them; she also reports that she ""sometimes forgets things that have happened"" – this indicates a moderate impairment of memory capacity.","Long-term memory (autobiographical, temporally remote) is not systematically tested; both plausible memories (residential address for 40 years, previous occupation, hospital stays) and nonspecific statements (""lost track of time"") are found, without a clear memory disorder being identifiable or definitively excluded.","The same event is not described multiple times with changing, fabricated memories; specific inquiries regarding this are lacking, so neither confabulations nor their absence can be reliably assessed.","No déjà-vu/jamais-vu experiences, flashbacks, intrusions, hypermnesias, or false memories are reported; however, paramnesias are not specifically explored, therefore there is insufficient information.","She does not describe her thinking as slowed or blocked, but only upon inquiry as ""currently rather a bit too slow""; a subjective experience of internal inhibition or blockage is not reported.","Speech and response latencies can only be assessed to a limited extent from the transcript; the conversation appears largely fluent, but without objective time measurements or direct observational impression, a reliable assessment of psychomotor slowing is not possible.","She often gives detailed, lengthy answers to questions with many incidental details (e.g., long explanations about Haribo varieties, semolina pudding, janitor, electrical outlets), but remains within the content context – this corresponds to slightly convoluted thinking.","Although the delusional-hallucinatory themes (God, fallen Vatican, power outlets) frequently appear, they can extend to numerous other topics (biography, work, everyday life, proverbs, suicide, orientation); there is no rigid adherence to only one theme.","There are no meaningless repetitions of previously mentioned words or information outside the current conversational context; repeated formulations (e.g., ""I’m not saying it"") are situationally appropriate and should not be considered perseverations.","She does not report distressing, repetitive worries or thought loops about her own problems; the distressing experiences are perceived as external voices and commands, not as internal fruitless rumination.","The patient describes rather slow thoughts and occasional thought emptiness (""blank""), but nowhere an experienced flooding of many thoughts or ideas.","The course of the conversation is predominantly goal-directed and thematically comprehensible; digressions are explained by the delusional content, not by loosely associated, constantly changing ideas.","The patient generally responds appropriately to the questions asked; even when interpreting proverbs, she attempts to answer content-wise without systematically missing the point of the question.","She reports states like a ""black hole,"" in which thoughts and parts of the brain are ""taken away,"" and loses the ""thread"" during arithmetic tasks; indications of occasionally abruptly interrupted train of thought with rather low distress.","Despite bizarre delusional themes, the linguistic coherence remains largely comprehensible to the examiner; there is no disintegration into unconnected sentence fragments or nonsensical word mixtures.","There are repeatedly unusual word formations such as ""verscharmüpseln,"" ""verballmützeln,"" ""Vorbeilhörneln,"" ""verschlummbeuteln,"" which do not conform to linguistic conventions; however, the overall context remains largely understandable.","Pronounced mistrust towards homeowners, janitors, and a worldwide group (""fallen out of God""), suspicion of surveillance through bugs and power outlets, thought theft and implantation; leads to severely impairing behavior (staying awake, rearranging furniture, tapping on the apartment, contacting the police, withholding personal data).","There is no excessive, anxious preoccupation with possible physical illnesses described; the concerns relate to persecution and thought manipulation, not the own body in terms of illness-related fears.","When asked about specific fears (e.g., of spiders, certain situations), the patient explicitly denies them and does not describe any circumscribed, recognized as excessive situational or object-related fear with avoidance.","The intrusive contents (""buy Haribo,"" ""do not talk"") are experienced as caused externally by voices or impulses, not as one's own thoughts, which are recognized as nonsensical and recurring against internal resistance.","No action impulses that impose themselves against internal resistance and are experienced as nonsensical are described; reported urges (e.g., buying sweets) are attributed to voices/external influence and are not experienced as own compulsive impulses. No sufficient evidence for or against compulsive impulses.","Repetitive actions (hitting a book on the Bible, rearranging furniture, tapping walls, sealing sockets) are experienced as meaningful protection or delusionally motivated search for ""bugs,"" not recognized as senseless or exaggerated, and are not performed against inner resistance. No indication of true compulsive actions in the AMDP sense, therefore not assessable as compulsive symptomatology.","No diffuse, difficult-to-justify state of a mysterious alteration or mere anticipatory tension is described, but rather a long-standing, content-wise clearly developed delusion with defined content. There are no indications of an independent delusional mood.","Neutral external perceptions receive delusional self-referential special significance, for example, that a TV presenter (Frauke Ludowig) is speaking on television and this is understood by the patient as a personal ""sign"" for themselves. Thus, a delusional self-referential meaning is attributed to an otherwise correct perception. These experiences are embedded in a pronounced delusional system and contribute significantly to the impairment.",Spontaneously newly occurring delusional convictions without prior perception are not clearly described as such during the interview; predominantly already consolidated convictions and delusionally interpreted perceptions are described. No clearly delineable current delusional episodes are identifiable.,"There have been longstanding fixed delusional beliefs: persecution by ""fallen ones from God out of the Vatican,"" surveillance through microphones installed in walls/outlets, thought withdrawal and insertion, divine mission, chosenness (""blessed ones,"" ""illuminated""), special powers for thought control. These beliefs are stable, not corrected, and significantly determine the patient's life.","The patient links numerous delusional elements into a largely developed system: fallen priests from the Vatican, involvement of the homeowner and janitor, technical surveillance (bugs, power outlets, microphones), media (""signs"" on television), religious references (God, cards, grandmother's songbook), thought withdrawal/insertion and behavioral control (Haribo, semolina pudding). These are causally and teleologically connected into a coherent ""story,"" with few open questions.","The patient reports sleep-disrupting, loud voices, remains awake at night, moves furniture, knocks on walls, and describes previous severe anxiety up to panicked leaving of the apartment. Currently, she describes her anxiety as ""it's actually okay,"" can distance herself at times (occasionally considers the persecutors to be ""a bit stupid""), and appears intermittently calm during the conversation. There is a clear but not permanently overwhelming affective involvement in the delusional experience.","Many neutral events and persons are related to the self with unshakable certainty: statements by a TV presenter are interpreted as personal signs, Bible verses and old notes from her grandmother (""There is no fear in love..."") are directly related to her own fate, the card ""speaks"" to her as God, sockets and technical devices serve as specific communication channels. She feels at the center of targeted attention and control, which strongly determines her daily life.","The patient perceives herself as the target of hostile activities by a group (""fallen from God from the Vatican"") as well as by the landlord/caretaker: surveillance and eavesdropping on the apartment through hidden microphones and sockets, insults, thought theft (""black hole,"" piece of brain missing), thought implantation (Haribo purchase, eating behavior), instructions not to leave the apartment and not to talk about it. This results in severe sleep disturbances, protective behaviors, police incidents, and repeated hospitalizations, indicating a severe impairment and persecutory delusion.",There are no statements indicating a delusional belief of being betrayed by the (life) partner; the topic of partnership/jealousy is not addressed in this sense.,There is no evidence of a delusional belief of having committed an unforgivable guilt; feelings of guilt or fears of punishment are not reported.,"Although financial matters (purchase of gummy bears, meals on wheels) are briefly mentioned, the patient does not express a delusional fear of financial ruin or insufficient means for subsistence.","The described experiences (e.g., ""a piece of the brain removed,"" ""black hole"") occur in the context of external influence and thought withdrawal, not as a delusional conviction of being severely physically or mentally ill.","She reports that God spoke directly to her as He did to Mary, telling her she is ""chosen,"" ""the illuminated one,"" ""the blessed one,"" and that she possesses special powers (implanting thoughts in others, controlling others, reading thoughts). This corresponds to a delusional self-aggrandizement with significant impairment, though less severe than that associated with persecutory delusions.","There is a pronounced systematic persecutory and impairment delusion: a worldwide group ""cast out of God from the Vatican"" is monitoring her via bugs/microphones installed in the walls and electrical outlets; janitors and landlords are involved; she is advised not to leave the apartment and is being influenced by technical means. Additionally, there is religious delusional content (divine mission to find/expose this group). This leads to significant distress, insomnia, conspicuous behavior (staying awake at night, rearranging furniture, tapping on walls until police intervention), and repeated hospitalizations.","She describes the environment as ""duller,"" ""as if the glasses are not cleaned,"" corners ""shrunken,"" thus a qualitative change in the perception of reality, but no misinterpretation of real objects or sounds as other content in the sense of illusions.","She continuously hears several male voices without an external stimulus, mostly coming from electrical outlets, sometimes in a choral manner, which comment on her, insult her, and give imperative commands (""say nothing,"" ""don't go to the injection anymore,"" ""buy Haribo,"" ""don't cook it so long""). She also reports a voice of God that gives her a mission. The voices have been present for a long time, are currently audible during the conversation, cause pronounced sleep disturbances and significant maladaptive behavior; thus, they are severely pronounced.",Only articulated voices are described; unarticulated noises or music without a source (akousma) are not reported.,"No visual perceptions without a real stimulus source (e.g., people, scenes, flashes of light) are reported; only a generally ""duller"" and grayer perception of the surroundings, which does not constitute an optical hallucination in the AMDP sense.",The statement contains no clear descriptions of abnormal bodily sensations or tactile hallucinations; there is no specific inquiry regarding these.,No spontaneous or upon request described perceptions of smell or taste without a stimulus source are reported.,"The patient describes the environment as ""a bit duller,"" ""as if the glasses are not cleaned,"" corners and ceilings ""shrunken"" and ""a bit gray."" This corresponds to an altered, unreal-strange perception of the environment with relatively low distress.",There are no reports of a self or body ego experienced as foreign or unreal; she does not describe any alienation from the self or non-belonging of body parts.,"She reports that she can ""take the thoughts out of my head, they then come out at the front"" and ""I can then put them onto others, and they then go into the others, into their heads."" This describes an extension of one's own thoughts beyond the boundaries of the head and their presence in the heads of others, without significant subjective distress.","She says: ""It is like a piece of the brain was removed, and then there is a black hole. And then they took my brain with the thoughts out."" This corresponds to the classic experience of thoughts being taken away by others, with a marked impairment of thinking.","She describes that thoughts are ""implanted"" in her, for example, the compulsion to buy and eat sour Haribo, conveyed through a kind of ""swimming cap"" with ""small things"" that ""shoot into the brain,"" especially at night. This is a clear experience of externally made/induced thoughts with relevant behavioral influence.","She experiences that those ""fallen"" from the Vatican control her through electrical outlets (""set me free and then I go to Kaufhof,"" ""I have to eat a lot of sweets,"" possibly having to do things ""I don't want to, like washing my hair""). Feelings and actions are experienced as externally caused and lead to significant impairment in daily life.","From the transcript, no clearly astonished-helpless, perplexed affect in the sense of the AMDP can be identified; nonverbal signs are absent, and direct expressions such as ""What is going on?"" or similar in an affective sense are not clearly documented.","She describes her current mood as ""neither one nor the other,"" rather neutral, without subjectively reported inner emptiness or the loss of feelings in the sense of a distressing numbness; no further targeted exploration is conducted on this.","In conversation, the patient displays differentiated affects (humor, irritation, neutrality) and responds emotionally to various topics; a restricted affective range is not evident.","There are no direct indications of general weakness, fatigability, or reduced sense of vitality; only age and use of a walker are mentioned.","When asked about her mood, she describes herself as ""neither,"" rather neutral, without sadness or dejection; no indication of a depressive mood.","She reports a fluctuating course (""sometimes better, sometimes worse""), accepts medication, and confirms that the injection/medications make the voices quieter; no pessimistic expectations for the future or abandonment of all hope are evident.","She describes persecutory and influence fears (intrusion into the apartment, thought withdrawal/insertion), remains awake out of fear, and sleeps only 1–2 hours; previous severe anxiety episodes are reported. Currently, she states that ""the anxiety is manageable,"" but the functional impairments are clearly present → moderate.","There is no evidence of elevated well-being, unrealistic confidence, or elevated mood; she describes her mood as rather neutral.","She appears cooperative, not persistently sullen, nagging, or ill-tempered; no typical dysphoric mood disturbance is described.","There are no inappropriately rapid or intense anger reactions, no aggression-tinged outbursts, or marked irritability in the interaction.","She reports staying awake out of vigilance but does not express any subjective inner nervousness, agitation, or perceived inner tension in the sense of being ""internally restless.""","She describes her burdens without exaggerated lamentation, without persistent complaining, sighing, or theatrically whining presentation; no excessively plaintive impression.","Despite clear psychotic symptoms, the patient does not express feelings of inferiority or worthlessness; she does not describe herself as incapable or useless, only once as somewhat ""clumsy"" when hammering, without a global sense of insufficiency.","The patient repeatedly reports being ""chosen"" by God, ""the blessed one"" and ""the illuminated one,"" having a special mission from God, and being able to control/read thoughts; this clearly exceeds normal self-esteem and is delusionally exaggerated, without a massive disintegration of everyday functioning described solely due to the elevated self-worth (moderate).","There are no expressions of guilt, remorse, or self-reproach; overeating sweets is reported rather neutrally or as an external comment (""becoming too fat""), without subjective experience of guilt.","No concerns about financial distress, impoverishment, or the inability to support oneself are mentioned.","The patient repeatedly exhibits simultaneous opposing tendencies, e.g., ""I won’t say it… I will say it…"" in the tension between obedience to the voices (saying nothing) and the mandate of the caregiver (saying everything), as well as ambivalent trust in the caregiver (""I do trust her. Mostly. Although…""). This leads to short-term internal tension and hesitation, but not to severe impairments.","From the pure conversation transcription, a discrepancy between emotional expression and content of experience (e.g., inappropriate laughter during distressing content) cannot be reliably assessed.","There are no clear descriptions of rapid shifts between different affects; statements regarding the emotional state remain rather neutral (""neither nor""). A reliable assessment of affective lability is not possible based on the text.","There are no reports of uncontrollable emotional outbursts that are excessive in response to minor triggers (e.g., incessant crying, temper tantrums); there is insufficient information on this in the text.","The transcription does not provide reliable indications regarding the modulatability of affect (facial expression, gestures, range of variation); therefore, affect rigidity cannot be assessed.","The patient reports activities such as cooking, shopping at Kaufhof, rearranging furniture at night, walks with a rollator, and participation in conversations; a lack of energy/initiative or a marked withdrawal from activities is not described.","In conversation, the patient does not report any subjectively experienced inhibition or blockage of drive (""wants to, but cannot""); explicit statements to this effect are lacking.","There are no clear indications of a general increase in energy and goal-directed activity beyond the usual level; nocturnal wakefulness and rearranging furniture are described within the context of the delusional symptoms, not as an experienced surge of energy.","No undirected motor restlessness (e.g., pacing, fidgeting, foot tapping) is described; no information is available regarding this.","Apart from the targeted hitting of the songbook to ward off the voices (goal-directed action), no qualitatively abnormal, stereotyped or tic-like movements, echolalia/echopraxia, or catalepsy are reported.","The conversational behavior is not described as affected, artificial, or particularly eccentric in terms of noticeable gestures/facial expressions/manner of speaking; explicit observations in this regard are lacking.","There is no evidence of exaggerated, audience-directed expressive behavior; the behavior appears rather simple-cooperative, without theatrical exaggeration.","The patient responds in detail, participates spontaneously in the conversation, and is neither taciturn nor silent; thus, mutism is certainly not present.","The flow of speech is within the framework of a structured interview; the examiner can ask questions and is not continuously interrupted, with no indications of an unrestrained, excessive flow of speech.","Although sleep onset and maintenance disturbances as well as nocturnal activity are described, there is no consistent morning worsening of symptoms; specific details are lacking in this regard.",A diurnal accentuation of symptoms in the evening is not mentioned during the interview; corresponding information is lacking.,"In the conversation, there are no indications of a regular improvement of the symptoms in the evening.","She lives alone, reports no friends or acquaintances (""not really""), and the only regular contact person mentioned is the caregiver, who actively initiates contact; leisure activities and other social contacts are largely absent, indicating a significant withdrawal initiated by her.","No increased, inappropriate, or superficial social contacts are described; purchases (e.g., gummy bears) are not made out of a need for social contact, but due to the voices.",Neither verbal hostility nor physically aggressive behavior towards people or objects is reported.,"She denies thoughts of not wanting to live anymore and refers to the fact that she ""is not allowed"" to do so; no death wishes, suicidal plans, or actions are reported.","The injury to the hand caused by hammering is described as unintentional (""was stupid,"" ""I rather don't think [it was intentional]""); no deliberate self-injurious behaviors without suicidal intent are reported.","She reports distress caused by voices, sleep deprivation, and persecution, repeatedly seeks help, accepts medication, and recognizes that it makes the voices quieter; this indicates the presence of insight into the illness.","The pronounced psychotic symptoms (persecutory delusions, voices from power outlets, divine mission, thought withdrawal and insertion) are consistently interpreted as real influences from ""those fallen from the Vatican"" and God, not as expressions of a mental illness; only slight, situational doubts during treatment, overall clearly lacking insight into the illness.","On the instruction of the voices, she did not pick up the necessary depot injection for about eight weeks (""then I thought, well, I won't go anymore""), but is currently taking medication again and agrees to another injection; thus, there was a temporary significant, although not persistent, refusal of necessary treatment.","Although she lives alone and can still cook and shop, she requires meals on wheels, has a legal guardian, and uses a rollator; this indicates a mild need for assistance with daily activities without comprehensive care dependency.","The patient is awake, responsive, and able to engage in dialogue throughout the entire conversation, with no signs of drowsiness, somnolence, or impaired reality contact despite sleep deprivation.","Despite delusional experiences, comprehensibility, ability to engage in contact, and goal-directed responses are preserved; there are no signs of globally impaired clarity of consciousness as seen in delirium.","The experience clearly revolves around voices, God, fallen Vatican figures, and power outlets; nevertheless, the patient is receptive to other topics (biography, daily life, tests, treatment); the thematic narrowing is present but can be easily overcome during conversation.","No experiences of particular clarity, intensification, or expansion of consciousness are reported; on the contrary, she describes reality as ""duller"" and ""gray.""","The patient reports that she has ""somewhat lost track of time"" and is uncertain whether events occurred two or three days ago and how long she has been on the ward; this indicates a slight uncertainty in the current temporal orientation.","She can correctly state her address (""Jungbuschstraße 3"") and current location (ZI, ward) and reports a long-term stay there; no indications of uncertainty regarding the location.","She understands that as a patient in the ZI ward, an admission/examination interview is being conducted and recorded, and she repeatedly correctly refers to previous stays; no situational misinterpretation.","She states her name, age (69 years), and address, reports coherently about her family, professional biography, and living conditions; no uncertainty regarding autobiographical basic data.","In the proverb test, idiomatic expressions are interpreted in a markedly concrete and meaning-distorting manner (""gift horse..."" = brushing teeth; ""apple does not fall far from the tree"" = eat more applesauce/apple lies in the meadow), and the figurative meaning is not understood even after explanation; additionally, there are comprehension difficulties with more abstract questions, despite overall preserved everyday communication.","In the Serial-7 test, she quickly loses track, makes calculation errors, focuses on formal aspects (""70, there is a 7 in it""), and aborts the task with ""I can't do it anymore""; additionally, she reports forgetting content and describes her thought process as ""too slow,"" indicating a moderately impaired sustained attention performance.","In the 3-word recall test, she is unable to freely recall any of the terms after a time interval, confuses the number (32/34/43), and requires clear cues (""Oslo,"" ""ashtray"") to partially reproduce them; she also reports that she ""sometimes forgets things that have happened"" – this indicates a moderate impairment of memory capacity.","Long-term memory (autobiographical, temporally remote) is not systematically tested; both plausible memories (residential address for 40 years, previous occupation, hospital stays) and nonspecific statements (""lost track of time"") are found, without a clear memory disorder being identifiable or definitively excluded.","The same event is not described multiple times with changing, fabricated memories; specific inquiries regarding this are lacking, so neither confabulations nor their absence can be reliably assessed.","No déjà-vu/jamais-vu experiences, flashbacks, intrusions, hypermnesias, or false memories are reported; however, paramnesias are not specifically explored, therefore there is insufficient information.","She does not describe her thinking as slowed or blocked, but only upon inquiry as ""currently rather a bit too slow""; a subjective experience of internal inhibition or blockage is not reported.","Speech and response latencies can only be assessed to a limited extent from the transcript; the conversation appears largely fluent, but without objective time measurements or direct observational impression, a reliable assessment of psychomotor slowing is not possible.","She often gives detailed, lengthy answers to questions with many incidental details (e.g., long explanations about Haribo varieties, semolina pudding, janitor, electrical outlets), but remains within the content context – this corresponds to slightly convoluted thinking.","Although the delusional-hallucinatory themes (God, fallen Vatican, power outlets) frequently appear, they can extend to numerous other topics (biography, work, everyday life, proverbs, suicide, orientation); there is no rigid adherence to only one theme.","There are no meaningless repetitions of previously mentioned words or information outside the current conversational context; repeated formulations (e.g., ""I’m not saying it"") are situationally appropriate and should not be considered perseverations.","She does not report distressing, repetitive worries or thought loops about her own problems; the distressing experiences are perceived as external voices and commands, not as internal fruitless rumination.","The patient describes rather slow thoughts and occasional thought emptiness (""blank""), but nowhere an experienced flooding of many thoughts or ideas.","The course of the conversation is predominantly goal-directed and thematically comprehensible; digressions are explained by the delusional content, not by loosely associated, constantly changing ideas.","The patient generally responds appropriately to the questions asked; even when interpreting proverbs, she attempts to answer content-wise without systematically missing the point of the question.","She reports states like a ""black hole,"" in which thoughts and parts of the brain are ""taken away,"" and loses the ""thread"" during arithmetic tasks; indications of occasionally abruptly interrupted train of thought with rather low distress.","Despite bizarre delusional themes, the linguistic coherence remains largely comprehensible to the examiner; there is no disintegration into unconnected sentence fragments or nonsensical word mixtures.","There are repeatedly unusual word formations such as ""verscharmüpseln,"" ""verballmützeln,"" ""Vorbeilhörneln,"" ""verschlummbeuteln,"" which do not conform to linguistic conventions; however, the overall context remains largely understandable.","Pronounced mistrust towards homeowners, janitors, and a worldwide group (""fallen out of God""), suspicion of surveillance through bugs and power outlets, thought theft and implantation; leads to severely impairing behavior (staying awake, rearranging furniture, tapping on the apartment, contacting the police, withholding personal data).","There is no excessive, anxious preoccupation with possible physical illnesses described; the concerns relate to persecution and thought manipulation, not the own body in terms of illness-related fears.","When asked about specific fears (e.g., of spiders, certain situations), the patient explicitly denies them and does not describe any circumscribed, recognized as excessive situational or object-related fear with avoidance.","The intrusive contents (""buy Haribo,"" ""do not talk"") are experienced as caused externally by voices or impulses, not as one's own thoughts, which are recognized as nonsensical and recurring against internal resistance.","No action impulses that impose themselves against internal resistance and are experienced as nonsensical are described; reported urges (e.g., buying sweets) are attributed to voices/external influence and are not experienced as own compulsive impulses. No sufficient evidence for or against compulsive impulses.","Repetitive actions (hitting a book on the Bible, rearranging furniture, tapping walls, sealing sockets) are experienced as meaningful protection or delusionally motivated search for ""bugs,"" not recognized as senseless or exaggerated, and are not performed against inner resistance. No indication of true compulsive actions in the AMDP sense, therefore not assessable as compulsive symptomatology.","No diffuse, difficult-to-justify state of a mysterious alteration or mere anticipatory tension is described, but rather a long-standing, content-wise clearly developed delusion with defined content. There are no indications of an independent delusional mood.","Neutral external perceptions receive delusional self-referential special significance, for example, that a TV presenter (Frauke Ludowig) is speaking on television and this is understood by the patient as a personal ""sign"" for themselves. Thus, a delusional self-referential meaning is attributed to an otherwise correct perception. These experiences are embedded in a pronounced delusional system and contribute significantly to the impairment.",Spontaneously newly occurring delusional convictions without prior perception are not clearly described as such during the interview; predominantly already consolidated convictions and delusionally interpreted perceptions are described. No clearly delineable current delusional episodes are identifiable.,"There have been longstanding fixed delusional beliefs: persecution by ""fallen ones from God out of the Vatican,"" surveillance through microphones installed in walls/outlets, thought withdrawal and insertion, divine mission, chosenness (""blessed ones,"" ""illuminated""), special powers for thought control. These beliefs are stable, not corrected, and significantly determine the patient's life.","The patient links numerous delusional elements into a largely developed system: fallen priests from the Vatican, involvement of the homeowner and janitor, technical surveillance (bugs, power outlets, microphones), media (""signs"" on television), religious references (God, cards, grandmother's songbook), thought withdrawal/insertion and behavioral control (Haribo, semolina pudding). These are causally and teleologically connected into a coherent ""story,"" with few open questions.","The patient reports sleep-disrupting, loud voices, remains awake at night, moves furniture, knocks on walls, and describes previous severe anxiety up to panicked leaving of the apartment. Currently, she describes her anxiety as ""it's actually okay,"" can distance herself at times (occasionally considers the persecutors to be ""a bit stupid""), and appears intermittently calm during the conversation. There is a clear but not permanently overwhelming affective involvement in the delusional experience.","Many neutral events and persons are related to the self with unshakable certainty: statements by a TV presenter are interpreted as personal signs, Bible verses and old notes from her grandmother (""There is no fear in love..."") are directly related to her own fate, the card ""speaks"" to her as God, sockets and technical devices serve as specific communication channels. She feels at the center of targeted attention and control, which strongly determines her daily life.","The patient perceives herself as the target of hostile activities by a group (""fallen from God from the Vatican"") as well as by the landlord/caretaker: surveillance and eavesdropping on the apartment through hidden microphones and sockets, insults, thought theft (""black hole,"" piece of brain missing), thought implantation (Haribo purchase, eating behavior), instructions not to leave the apartment and not to talk about it. This results in severe sleep disturbances, protective behaviors, police incidents, and repeated hospitalizations, indicating a severe impairment and persecutory delusion.",There are no statements indicating a delusional belief of being betrayed by the (life) partner; the topic of partnership/jealousy is not addressed in this sense.,There is no evidence of a delusional belief of having committed an unforgivable guilt; feelings of guilt or fears of punishment are not reported.,"Although financial matters (purchase of gummy bears, meals on wheels) are briefly mentioned, the patient does not express a delusional fear of financial ruin or insufficient means for subsistence.","The described experiences (e.g., ""a piece of the brain removed,"" ""black hole"") occur in the context of external influence and thought withdrawal, not as a delusional conviction of being severely physically or mentally ill.","She reports that God spoke directly to her as He did to Mary, telling her she is ""chosen,"" ""the illuminated one,"" ""the blessed one,"" and that she possesses special powers (implanting thoughts in others, controlling others, reading thoughts). This corresponds to a delusional self-aggrandizement with significant impairment, though less severe than that associated with persecutory delusions.","There is a pronounced systematic persecutory and impairment delusion: a worldwide group ""cast out of God from the Vatican"" is monitoring her via bugs/microphones installed in the walls and electrical outlets; janitors and landlords are involved; she is advised not to leave the apartment and is being influenced by technical means. Additionally, there is religious delusional content (divine mission to find/expose this group). This leads to significant distress, insomnia, conspicuous behavior (staying awake at night, rearranging furniture, tapping on walls until police intervention), and repeated hospitalizations.","She describes the environment as ""duller,"" ""as if the glasses are not cleaned,"" corners ""shrunken,"" thus a qualitative change in the perception of reality, but no misinterpretation of real objects or sounds as other content in the sense of illusions.","She continuously hears several male voices without an external stimulus, mostly coming from electrical outlets, sometimes in a choral manner, which comment on her, insult her, and give imperative commands (""say nothing,"" ""don't go to the injection anymore,"" ""buy Haribo,"" ""don't cook it so long""). She also reports a voice of God that gives her a mission. The voices have been present for a long time, are currently audible during the conversation, cause pronounced sleep disturbances and significant maladaptive behavior; thus, they are severely pronounced.",Only articulated voices are described; unarticulated noises or music without a source (akousma) are not reported.,"No visual perceptions without a real stimulus source (e.g., people, scenes, flashes of light) are reported; only a generally ""duller"" and grayer perception of the surroundings, which does not constitute an optical hallucination in the AMDP sense.",The statement contains no clear descriptions of abnormal bodily sensations or tactile hallucinations; there is no specific inquiry regarding these.,No spontaneous or upon request described perceptions of smell or taste without a stimulus source are reported.,"The patient describes the environment as ""a bit duller,"" ""as if the glasses are not cleaned,"" corners and ceilings ""shrunken"" and ""a bit gray."" This corresponds to an altered, unreal-strange perception of the environment with relatively low distress.",There are no reports of a self or body ego experienced as foreign or unreal; she does not describe any alienation from the self or non-belonging of body parts.,"She reports that she can ""take the thoughts out of my head, they then come out at the front"" and ""I can then put them onto others, and they then go into the others, into their heads."" This describes an extension of one's own thoughts beyond the boundaries of the head and their presence in the heads of others, without significant subjective distress.","She says: ""It is like a piece of the brain was removed, and then there is a black hole. And then they took my brain with the thoughts out."" This corresponds to the classic experience of thoughts being taken away by others, with a marked impairment of thinking.","She describes that thoughts are ""implanted"" in her, for example, the compulsion to buy and eat sour Haribo, conveyed through a kind of ""swimming cap"" with ""small things"" that ""shoot into the brain,"" especially at night. This is a clear experience of externally made/induced thoughts with relevant behavioral influence.","She experiences that those ""fallen"" from the Vatican control her through electrical outlets (""set me free and then I go to Kaufhof,"" ""I have to eat a lot of sweets,"" possibly having to do things ""I don't want to, like washing my hair""). Feelings and actions are experienced as externally caused and lead to significant impairment in daily life.","From the transcript, no clearly astonished-helpless, perplexed affect in the sense of the AMDP can be identified; nonverbal signs are absent, and direct expressions such as ""What is going on?"" or similar in an affective sense are not clearly documented.","She describes her current mood as ""neither one nor the other,"" rather neutral, without subjectively reported inner emptiness or the loss of feelings in the sense of a distressing numbness; no further targeted exploration is conducted on this.","In conversation, the patient displays differentiated affects (humor, irritation, neutrality) and responds emotionally to various topics; a restricted affective range is not evident.","There are no direct indications of general weakness, fatigability, or reduced sense of vitality; only age and use of a walker are mentioned.","When asked about her mood, she describes herself as ""neither,"" rather neutral, without sadness or dejection; no indication of a depressive mood.","She reports a fluctuating course (""sometimes better, sometimes worse""), accepts medication, and confirms that the injection/medications make the voices quieter; no pessimistic expectations for the future or abandonment of all hope are evident.","She describes persecutory and influence fears (intrusion into the apartment, thought withdrawal/insertion), remains awake out of fear, and sleeps only 1–2 hours; previous severe anxiety episodes are reported. Currently, she states that ""the anxiety is manageable,"" but the functional impairments are clearly present → moderate.","There is no evidence of elevated well-being, unrealistic confidence, or elevated mood; she describes her mood as rather neutral.","She appears cooperative, not persistently sullen, nagging, or ill-tempered; no typical dysphoric mood disturbance is described.","There are no inappropriately rapid or intense anger reactions, no aggression-tinged outbursts, or marked irritability in the interaction.","She reports staying awake out of vigilance but does not express any subjective inner nervousness, agitation, or perceived inner tension in the sense of being ""internally restless.""","She describes her burdens without exaggerated lamentation, without persistent complaining, sighing, or theatrically whining presentation; no excessively plaintive impression.","Despite clear psychotic symptoms, the patient does not express feelings of inferiority or worthlessness; she does not describe herself as incapable or useless, only once as somewhat ""clumsy"" when hammering, without a global sense of insufficiency.","The patient repeatedly reports being ""chosen"" by God, ""the blessed one"" and ""the illuminated one,"" having a special mission from God, and being able to control/read thoughts; this clearly exceeds normal self-esteem and is delusionally exaggerated, without a massive disintegration of everyday functioning described solely due to the elevated self-worth (moderate).","There are no expressions of guilt, remorse, or self-reproach; overeating sweets is reported rather neutrally or as an external comment (""becoming too fat""), without subjective experience of guilt.","No concerns about financial distress, impoverishment, or the inability to support oneself are mentioned.","The patient repeatedly exhibits simultaneous opposing tendencies, e.g., ""I won’t say it… I will say it…"" in the tension between obedience to the voices (saying nothing) and the mandate of the caregiver (saying everything), as well as ambivalent trust in the caregiver (""I do trust her. Mostly. Although…""). This leads to short-term internal tension and hesitation, but not to severe impairments.","From the pure conversation transcription, a discrepancy between emotional expression and content of experience (e.g., inappropriate laughter during distressing content) cannot be reliably assessed.","There are no clear descriptions of rapid shifts between different affects; statements regarding the emotional state remain rather neutral (""neither nor""). A reliable assessment of affective lability is not possible based on the text.","There are no reports of uncontrollable emotional outbursts that are excessive in response to minor triggers (e.g., incessant crying, temper tantrums); there is insufficient information on this in the text.","The transcription does not provide reliable indications regarding the modulatability of affect (facial expression, gestures, range of variation); therefore, affect rigidity cannot be assessed.","The patient reports activities such as cooking, shopping at Kaufhof, rearranging furniture at night, walks with a rollator, and participation in conversations; a lack of energy/initiative or a marked withdrawal from activities is not described.","In conversation, the patient does not report any subjectively experienced inhibition or blockage of drive (""wants to, but cannot""); explicit statements to this effect are lacking.","There are no clear indications of a general increase in energy and goal-directed activity beyond the usual level; nocturnal wakefulness and rearranging furniture are described within the context of the delusional symptoms, not as an experienced surge of energy.","No undirected motor restlessness (e.g., pacing, fidgeting, foot tapping) is described; no information is available regarding this.","Apart from the targeted hitting of the songbook to ward off the voices (goal-directed action), no qualitatively abnormal, stereotyped or tic-like movements, echolalia/echopraxia, or catalepsy are reported.","The conversational behavior is not described as affected, artificial, or particularly eccentric in terms of noticeable gestures/facial expressions/manner of speaking; explicit observations in this regard are lacking.","There is no evidence of exaggerated, audience-directed expressive behavior; the behavior appears rather simple-cooperative, without theatrical exaggeration.","The patient responds in detail, participates spontaneously in the conversation, and is neither taciturn nor silent; thus, mutism is certainly not present.","The flow of speech is within the framework of a structured interview; the examiner can ask questions and is not continuously interrupted, with no indications of an unrestrained, excessive flow of speech.","Although sleep onset and maintenance disturbances as well as nocturnal activity are described, there is no consistent morning worsening of symptoms; specific details are lacking in this regard.",A diurnal accentuation of symptoms in the evening is not mentioned during the interview; corresponding information is lacking.,"In the conversation, there are no indications of a regular improvement of the symptoms in the evening.","She lives alone, reports no friends or acquaintances (""not really""), and the only regular contact person mentioned is the caregiver, who actively initiates contact; leisure activities and other social contacts are largely absent, indicating a significant withdrawal initiated by her.","No increased, inappropriate, or superficial social contacts are described; purchases (e.g., gummy bears) are not made out of a need for social contact, but due to the voices.",Neither verbal hostility nor physically aggressive behavior towards people or objects is reported.,"She denies thoughts of not wanting to live anymore and refers to the fact that she ""is not allowed"" to do so; no death wishes, suicidal plans, or actions are reported.","The injury to the hand caused by hammering is described as unintentional (""was stupid,"" ""I rather don't think [it was intentional]""); no deliberate self-injurious behaviors without suicidal intent are reported.","She reports distress caused by voices, sleep deprivation, and persecution, repeatedly seeks help, accepts medication, and recognizes that it makes the voices quieter; this indicates the presence of insight into the illness.","The pronounced psychotic symptoms (persecutory delusions, voices from power outlets, divine mission, thought withdrawal and insertion) are consistently interpreted as real influences from ""those fallen from the Vatican"" and God, not as expressions of a mental illness; only slight, situational doubts during treatment, overall clearly lacking insight into the illness.","On the instruction of the voices, she did not pick up the necessary depot injection for about eight weeks (""then I thought, well, I won't go anymore""), but is currently taking medication again and agrees to another injection; thus, there was a temporary significant, although not persistent, refusal of necessary treatment.","Although she lives alone and can still cook and shop, she requires meals on wheels, has a legal guardian, and uses a rollator; this indicates a mild need for assistance with daily activities without comprehensive care dependency."

In the 100-minus-7 test, she makes early errors in subtraction, loses track, and discontinues the task; there are also confusions when trying to remember three terms. This indicates a marked, but not maximal, concentration disorder.","In the memory test (Oslo, ashtray, 32), there are confusions of the number (32/34/43) and the terms are only partially recalled after distraction or only after significant prompting; additionally, she reports that she sometimes forgets things. This indicates a mild impairment of memory capacity without evidence of significant impairment in daily functioning.","The patient can report biographical data (residential address for 40 years, previous occupation as a saleswoman at Kaufhof, previous inpatient stays since 1976) in a temporally and content-wise plausible manner; there are no indications of amnesia or significant disturbances of long-term memory or temporal orientation.","With repeated inquiries about the same content (e.g., voices, landlord, mission from God, previous stays), the information remains essentially consistent; there are no changing, memory gap-filling pseudo-memories in the sense of confabulations.","Neither déjà-vu/jamais-vu experiences nor flashbacks, intrusions, hyper-/ekmnesias, or false memories are addressed; there is no targeted exploration of these, therefore no sufficient information.","When asked about her thought process, the patient currently describes her thinking as ""rather a bit too slow""; this corresponds to a subjectively slowed thought process, without reporting a pronounced blockage or severe distress (mild severity).","The actual speech and thought tempo (pauses, response latencies) cannot be reliably assessed from the transcript, and the examiner does not provide an explicit external evaluation in this regard; therefore, a reliable assessment is not possible.","The responses are predominantly brief and remain focused on the respective question; she does not get lost in incidental details and achieves the conversational goal, so no cumbersome, rambling thinking is evident.","Despite pronounced delusional themes (God, electrical outlets, voices), the patient can engage with other topics (affect, biography, daily life, proverbs, orientation) without apparent difficulty and remain on them; there is no evidence of fixation on only one or a few topics in the sense of formal thought narrowing.","Word and sentence repetitions (e.g., ""I’m not saying it"") appear context-bound and content-motivated (ambivalence, influence of voices) and not as senseless, mechanical repetition of previously said content in inappropriate contexts; perseverations are not evident.","The patient does not report distressing, unproductive rumination about worries or burdensome topics; this is also not specifically inquired about. Therefore, there is insufficient information to assess rumination.","The patient explicitly describes her thought process as rather slow and reports a lack of thoughts, not an abundance of intrusive thoughts or internal pressure to think.","Thinking appears predominantly goal-directed and thematically bound; despite bizarre content, she returns to questions without abrupt, associatively drifting topic changes indicative of flight of ideas.","The examiner's questions are generally understood and answered appropriately in content; the literal, concrete interpretation of proverbs does not represent systematic evasion.","She reports episodes in which it feels ""as if a piece of the brain is removed"" and then a ""black hole"" forms and the thoughts are gone; additionally, she describes losing the thread – indicative of episodic thought blocking within an otherwise largely fluent conversation.","Despite bizarre-delusional content, the thought process remains comprehensible to the examiner during the course of the conversation, the sentence structure is intact, and there is no disintegration into illogical, incoherent sentence or word fragments.","There are repeated idiosyncratic word formations such as ""verscharmüpseln,"" ""verballmützeln,"" and ""Vorbeilhörneln,"" which deviate from usual linguistic conventions and are semantically unusual, without significantly impairing the comprehensibility of the overall context.","Pronounced hostile-anxious reference to others: she suspects landlords, caretakers, a worldwide organization, and potentially also healthcare providers of monitoring and influencing her through power outlets and bugs; she does not disclose personal data (e.g., date of birth) out of mistrust and practically trusts only one caregiver – with significant impact on daily life and social contacts.","There are no anxious-worrying fears of illness or excessive monitoring of bodily processes; experienced interventions on the brain are described within the context of a delusion of influence, not as fear of being physically ill.",She explicitly denies specific fears such as of spiders or certain situations; no circumscribed phobic fears or phobic avoidance are reported.,"Intrusive content is experienced as voices and implanted thoughts from external forces (God, ""fallen ones from the Vatican""), not as one's own, senselessly recognized, repetitively intrusive obsessive thoughts; the act of hitting the book is experienced as a meaningful protective action inspired by God, not as an ego-dystonic compulsion.","No compelling, subjectively experienced nonsensical action impulses are described arising from within; action commands come from voices (imperative hallucinations) and are not experienced as one's own compulsive impulses.","Repetitive actions (e.g., hitting the book, rearranging furniture, tapping walls, covering electrical outlets) are experienced as meaningful protection within the context of the delusion and are not recognized as senseless or excessive; they serve the purpose of delusional experience, not as compulsive rituals.","No diffuse, content-wise still indeterminate anticipatory tension is described, but rather a developed delusion with clear content; there are no indications specifically pointing to a predominant delusional mood.","Real perceived content (e.g., statements by a television presenter, texts in grandmother’s song/prayer book, drawn cards) is interpreted as personal signs and divine commands.

The patient is able to report a coherent, causally paralogical ""story,"" with open questions answered within the framework of the system.","Clear affective involvement in the delusional experience: strong inner tension, hesitation and internal conflicts when speaking (""I won’t say it""), sleep deprivation due to staying awake and control behavior, loud music to counteract voices, nocturnal rearranging of furniture and tapping on walls. At the same time, she reports that the anxiety is ""actually manageable"" and does not appear highly agitated or desperate, so the dynamic is to be assessed as moderate.","Neutral events and persons are delusionally related to herself, e.g., she experiences statements by a television presenter as personal ""signs"" and perceives various technical devices (sockets, bugs) and persons (janitor, homeowner) as specifically directed at her. The referential aspect is clearly present and leads to behavioral adjustments, but is primarily part of the overall persecutory delusion.","Firm conviction of being the target of hostile actions: a group of ""those fallen from God,"" supported by the janitor/landlord, monitors, insults, and manipulates her via bugs/power outlets, steals and implants thoughts, and aims to prevent her from speaking about them or leaving the apartment. This results in significant impairments (severe sleep disturbance, constant checking, tapping on walls until police intervention, failure to pick up depot injection, restriction of daily living), corresponding to a severe impairment and persecutory delusion.",No statements regarding partnerships or infidelity; there are no indications of jealousy-related delusional themes.,The patient does not report having committed unforgivable errors or being delusionally guilty; no corresponding content was present in the conversation.,No financial fears or delusional beliefs of impending financial ruin are expressed.,"No delusional conviction of being severely physically or mentally ill; somatic complaints are limited to metaphors (e.g., ""black hole"" in the brain) within the context of experiences of external influence.","The patient perceives herself as ""chosen,"" ""illuminated,"" and ""blessed"" with a divine mission (""you are chosen... bring them to me"") and reports special abilities (transmitting thoughts from her head to others, controlling others, reading thoughts). This corresponds to a delusional self-aggrandizement, with noticeable but not dominant impairment in daily life.","Pronounced systematic persecutory and influence delusion: ""fallen out of God from the Vatican"" have installed microphones/bugs everywhere in the apartment, speak to her through power outlets, eavesdrop on her, influence behavior (not leaving the apartment, eating certain sweets, cooking semolina porridge), landlord and janitor are ""all in cahoots."" Long-standing chronicity, police intervention, significant everyday relevance, and marked impairment (sleep deprivation, ritual behaviors, therapy discontinuations) indicate severe delusion.","No misperceptions of real objects or sounds are described; the patient reports altered perception quality (""duller, as if the glasses are not cleaned""), but no typical illusion symptoms.","Clearly articulated, dialogic and imperative voices without a real source: male voices from electrical outlets, sometimes choral, insulting her, forbidding her to speak (""say nothing""), and giving commands (""go to Kaufhof and buy sweets,"" do not leave the apartment). She also currently hears them during conversation (""right now at this moment? – Yes.""). Marked distress and significant impairment (insomnia, loud music, protective rituals, inpatient treatment).","Only auditory verbal hallucinations (voices) are described; no reports of nonverbal sounds without an external stimulus (e.g., ringing, hissing).","No reports of seeing unreal persons, objects, light phenomena, or scenes; only a perception of reality experienced as ""dull, gray, shrunken"" without hallucinatory quality.","She describes it as ""like a piece of the brain being removed"" and then there is ""a black hole"" there; this is a bizarre, qualitatively altered bodily sensation (coenesthesia) with rather limited expressed distress.","In the interview, there are no indications of spontaneous olfactory or gustatory perceptions without a stimulus source.","She experiences the environment as ""duller,"" ""as if the glasses are not cleaned,"" with ""shrunken"" corners and ""a bit gray"" – an altered, unreal perception of the surroundings, which, however, is not described as highly distressing.","There are no statements indicating that she experiences herself or body parts as foreign, unreal, or not belonging to herself.","She reports being able to ""put thoughts into others"" and hear the thoughts of others, but does not describe her own thoughts spreading involuntarily or others directly sharing in them (no typical experience of thought broadcasting).","She says it is ""as if a piece of the brain were removed,"" then there is ""a black hole,"" and ""then they took the brain out with the thoughts""; this experience of withdrawn, no longer available thoughts is clear and leads to noticeable impairment.","She describes that, for example, the thought of buying sour Haribo is ""implanted,"" like with a cap with electrodes that ""shoot"" something into the brain, and that these thoughts are not truly her own; this significantly influences her behavior (shopping, eating).","She experiences comprehensive external control of behavior and bodily functions by ""fallen ones from the Vatican"" through power outlets/microphones (e.g., compulsion to buy sweets, stay awake, perform certain actions, thoughts and ""brain"" are taken away) and uses protective rituals (hitting the hymnal); this leads to significant impairment of daily life, sleep, and treatment (e.g., discontinuation of depot injection at the command of the voices).","From the transcript, facial expressions, gestures, and the specific affect of a amazed-helpless perplexity cannot be reliably assessed; explicit indications are lacking.","Upon inquiry, she describes her mood as ""neither one nor the other,"" rather neutral, without complaining of feeling internally empty, cold, or emotionally desolate; a subjective feeling of numbness is not expressed.","In conversation, the patient displays various affects (e.g., slight anxiety/tension, humor with proverbs, enjoyment of gummy bears, trust in the caregiver). There is no indication of a significantly restricted affective range or a monotonous affective expression.","The patient reports sleep disturbances and advanced age but does not express subjective weakness, fatigability, or a reduced sense of vitality according to the AMDP definition. Vital feeling is not directly inquired about, therefore there is insufficient information.","When asked about her current mood, she describes herself as ""neither,"" rather neutral, without emphasizing sadness or dejection. There is no evidence of a depressed affect, no crying, no expressions such as ""sad,"" ""dejected,"" or worries indicative of a depressive baseline mood.","Despite the long-standing psychosis, she reports that the voices are ""sometimes better, sometimes worse"" and acknowledges an improvement of the voices under medication. There are no expressions of a pessimistic expectation for the future (""it will never get better,"" ""I have given up all hope"").","She describes that she stays awake at night and ""keeps watch,"" can hardly sleep, and moves furniture or taps on walls out of fear of bugs/microphones as well as fear that her thoughts are being stolen or implanted. She reports that the anxiety is ""sometimes already"" present and attributes previous severe anxiety episodes (fleeing the apartment naked) to a similar issue. The extent of impairment (severely disturbed sleep, hypervigilant behavior) indicates at least moderate anxiety during the assessment period, even though she simultaneously downplays the anxiety (""it's actually okay"").","There are no phases of excessive cheerfulness, no unusually good well-being, no unrealistic optimism, or increased vitality. The patient describes her mood as rather neutral.","The patient does not appear consistently sullen, nagging, or ill-tempered. Criticism or complaints specifically relate to the alleged persecution, not as a general irritable mood. A dysphoric affect in the sense of persistent ill temper is not evident.","There is no evidence of rapid or intense anger reactions, aggressive outbursts, or noticeable tense irritability. The interaction is cooperative and without any apparent readiness for aggression.","Although she remains awake at night and is engaged in defensive actions against the presumed pursuers, she does not describe her inner experience as nervous, agitated, ""internally driven,"" or ""like 10 cups of coffee."" An explicit indication of inner restlessness is lacking; therefore, there is insufficient data according to the AMDP definition.","The patient reports her complaints largely objectively, without exaggerated lamentation, persistent whining, sighing, or theatrically expressive complaint. An excessive display of complaining is not evident during the conversation.","No expressions of worthlessness, failure, or incapacity; on the contrary, she experiences herself as chosen and endowed with special abilities.","She reports being chosen by God to be ""the Illuminated"" and ""the Blessed,"" with a special mission and specific powers (transmitting thoughts, reading thoughts). This clearly exceeds a realistic self-image and is embedded in a delusional system, impairing reality assessment, without describing significant social consequences (e.g., pronounced arrogance).","There are no expressions of guilt, remorse, or self-reproach; the topic is not evidently addressed.",No indications of experienced or feared impoverishment or concerns about existential financial hardship; financial issues are not described as distressing.,"She describes mixed feelings toward the caregiver (""I do trust her. Mostly.""), while also experiencing mistrust, as well as an internal back-and-forth between obedience to the voices (""don't say it"") and following the caregiver's/doctor's request to tell everything. This demonstrates contradictory simultaneous tendencies but results only in mild distress or slight impairment (hesitant speech, repeated ""I won't say it/I will say it"").",The transcript does not provide clear evidence that the displayed emotional expression systematically does not correspond to the content of the conversation.,"No rapid affective shifts are described or observable; the patient appears rather consistently neutral during the conversation, without pronounced fluctuations of emotions.","There is no evidence of excessive affective reactions triggered by minor stimuli that the patient can no longer control (no continuous crying, laughing, or outbursts described).","Although she describes her mood as rather neutral (""neither nor""), there are no explicit observations of a reduced affective modulation ability or significantly flattened affective dynamics.","She reports various activities (cooking for herself, regularly going to Kaufhof, moving furniture at night, using a walker) without complaints of lack of energy or initiative; rather normal or partly increased activity, so that lack of drive is certainly not present.","The patient does not report that activities are exceptionally arduous or that she wants to do something but cannot due to an internally experienced blockade; she cooks, goes shopping, and moves furniture without describing subjective drive inhibition.","There is no evidence of increased energy, initiative, or enhanced goal-directed activity beyond the usual; the described activities (e.g., rearranging furniture, shopping) are delusion-driven but are not described as a general increase in drive.","Neither in the conversation nor in the self-report is an increased, undirected motor restlessness (e.g., fidgeting, aimless walking) described; the moving of furniture is purposeful for bug searching and does not meet the criterion of undirected motor restlessness.","No qualitatively abnormal, stereotyped, or automatic movements, no echolalia, echopraxia, tics, or postural stereotypies are reported.","The patient does not appear affected, pompous, or conspicuously stylized in speech and behavior in the record; no bizarre postures or artificially eccentric everyday movements are described, but content-wise delusional, yet formally simple behavior.","There is no evidence of exaggerated demonstrative behavior, wild gesticulation, or aggravating, effect-oriented complaint descriptions; the patient reports her experiences in a rather factual manner.","The patient is very forthcoming in conversation, responding in a detailed and spontaneous manner; there is neither poverty of speech nor mutism or a significant impoverishment of linguistic interaction.","Although the conversation is extensive in content, the patient does not take control of the conversation, does not continuously interrupt the examiner, and does not exhibit an uninterrupted, hardly stoppable flow of speech; responses are mostly given in response to questions.",No regular diurnal fluctuations with morning lows are described; no information is available regarding well-being specifically in the morning.,No regular diurnal fluctuations with evening lows are reported; no usable information regarding well-being specifically in the evening is found in the conversation.,There is no information indicating a consistent improvement of symptoms in the evening compared to other times of the day.,"Few social contacts are reported (""not so"" friends/acquaintances, lives alone), but no clear withdrawal initiated by the patient or lack of need for contact is described; therefore, a definitive assessment is not possible.","There is no evidence of an increase in social activities or contact perceived as intrusive; on the contrary, rather few contacts and hardly any leisure activities are described.","Neither verbal hostility nor violent acts against persons or property with hostile intent are described; the hammering on walls occurs in the context of bug searching and is not described as aggressive behavior. Overall, however, there is too little targeted information, therefore no reliable assessment can be made.","Upon direct inquiry, the patient denies suicidal thoughts and actions (""No, because I am not allowed to, Mrs. Dürschke said so""), and no wishes for death or suicidal plans are reported.","The patient reports an injury to the hand while hammering on the wall but emphasizes that this was not intentional (""Was it intentional? – I rather don't think so.""). Deliberate self-harming behavior with intent is denied.","The patient reports significant distress due to voices, sleep deprivation, and experiences of persecution, and accepts that medication/injection makes the voices quieter. She therefore does not feel healthy, but clearly impaired.","The auditory hallucinations and bizarre experiences are consistently attributed to a group believed to be real (""those fallen out of the Vatican by God"") and technical installations (microphones/bugs, power outlets, EEG-like cap); she sees herself as ""chosen"" and ""blessed"" with a divine mission. A mental illness as the cause of the symptoms is not recognizably acknowledged, although she describes the effect of the medications on the voices. This results in a pronounced discrepancy with the medical disease model.","At the voices' instruction (""the voices said I should no longer go and pick up the injection""), the patient did not collect the required depot injection for about eight weeks, resulting in a significant deterioration. Currently, however, she is willing to resume medication and injection treatment, which is why the refusal is classified as moderate.","The patient lives alone, can cook, shop (goes to Kaufhof with a rollator), and only receives meals on wheels; the need for assistance with basic activities of daily living (dressing, personal hygiene, food intake) is not described.","The patient is awake throughout the entire conversation, well responsive, neither drowsy nor somnolent, and shows no impairment of vigilance.","Despite pronounced psychotic symptoms, the patient is able to understand her situation, provide biographical information, and report largely coherently; there is no evidence of a global impairment of consciousness clarity in the sense of a delirium.","The patient is strongly preoccupied with voices and persecutory ideas in terms of content, but is able to engage with various topics (biography, proverbs, everyday life, tests); there is no clearly narrowed responsiveness to external stimuli in the sense of a ""tunnel consciousness.""","No experiences of increased clarity or intensified perception are reported; on the contrary, she describes the environment as ""duller"" and ""gray,"" which argues against an alteration of consciousness.","The patient only vaguely states that she has ""somewhat lost track of time""; no targeted assessment of the date, day of the week, or year is conducted; a temporal orientation disorder according to the AMDP definition cannot be definitively confirmed or denied.","She knows that she is in the emergency department, knows her home address (""Jungbuschstraße 3""), and reports having lived there for 40 years; no indications of disorientation regarding her current location.","The patient understands that she is being examined as a patient in a psychiatric clinic, knows the purpose of the stay (voices, medication), and can contextualize previous treatments; thus, the current situation is comprehended within her framework of meaning.","She is aware of her age (69 years), life history (previous occupation as a saleswoman at Kaufhof), family situation, and address; there are no indications of disorientation regarding her own person.","In the interpretation of proverbs, she clearly shows concretistic interpretations (""don't look a gift horse in the mouth"" = brushing teeth; ""the apple does not fall far from the tree"" = eat more applesauce / apple in the meadow) and is unable to comprehend the abstract meaning even after explanation; this corresponds to a moderate degree of conceptual disorder.","She reports that her thoughts are ""rather a bit too slow"" and that she forgets things. In the 100-minus-7 test, she makes early errors in subtraction, loses track, and discontinues the task; there are also confusions when trying to remember three terms. This indicates a marked, but not maximal, concentration disorder.","In the memory test (Oslo, ashtray, 32), there are confusions of the number (32/34/43) and the terms are only partially recalled after distraction or only after significant prompting; additionally, she reports that she sometimes forgets things. This indicates a mild impairment of memory capacity without evidence of significant impairment in daily functioning.","The patient can report biographical data (residential address for 40 years, previous occupation as a saleswoman at Kaufhof, previous inpatient stays since 1976) in a temporally and content-wise plausible manner; there are no indications of amnesia or significant disturbances of long-term memory or temporal orientation.","With repeated inquiries about the same content (e.g., voices, landlord, mission from God, previous stays), the information remains essentially consistent; there are no changing, memory gap-filling pseudo-memories in the sense of confabulations.","Neither déjà-vu/jamais-vu experiences nor flashbacks, intrusions, hyper-/ekmnesias, or false memories are addressed; there is no targeted exploration of these, therefore no sufficient information.","When asked about her thought process, the patient currently describes her thinking as ""rather a bit too slow""; this corresponds to a subjectively slowed thought process, without reporting a pronounced blockage or severe distress (mild severity).","The actual speech and thought tempo (pauses, response latencies) cannot be reliably assessed from the transcript, and the examiner does not provide an explicit external evaluation in this regard; therefore, a reliable assessment is not possible.","The responses are predominantly brief and remain focused on the respective question; she does not get lost in incidental details and achieves the conversational goal, so no cumbersome, rambling thinking is evident.","Despite pronounced delusional themes (God, electrical outlets, voices), the patient can engage with other topics (affect, biography, daily life, proverbs, orientation) without apparent difficulty and remain on them; there is no evidence of fixation on only one or a few topics in the sense of formal thought narrowing.","Word and sentence repetitions (e.g., ""I’m not saying it"") appear context-bound and content-motivated (ambivalence, influence of voices) and not as senseless, mechanical repetition of previously said content in inappropriate contexts; perseverations are not evident.","The patient does not report distressing, unproductive rumination about worries or burdensome topics; this is also not specifically inquired about. Therefore, there is insufficient information to assess rumination.","The patient explicitly describes her thought process as rather slow and reports a lack of thoughts, not an abundance of intrusive thoughts or internal pressure to think.","Thinking appears predominantly goal-directed and thematically bound; despite bizarre content, she returns to questions without abrupt, associatively drifting topic changes indicative of flight of ideas.","The examiner's questions are generally understood and answered appropriately in content; the literal, concrete interpretation of proverbs does not represent systematic evasion.","She reports episodes in which it feels ""as if a piece of the brain is removed"" and then a ""black hole"" forms and the thoughts are gone; additionally, she describes losing the thread – indicative of episodic thought blocking within an otherwise largely fluent conversation.","Despite bizarre-delusional content, the thought process remains comprehensible to the examiner during the course of the conversation, the sentence structure is intact, and there is no disintegration into illogical, incoherent sentence or word fragments.","There are repeated idiosyncratic word formations such as ""verscharmüpseln,"" ""verballmützeln,"" and ""Vorbeilhörneln,"" which deviate from usual linguistic conventions and are semantically unusual, without significantly impairing the comprehensibility of the overall context.","Pronounced hostile-anxious reference to others: she suspects landlords, caretakers, a worldwide organization, and potentially also healthcare providers of monitoring and influencing her through power outlets and bugs; she does not disclose personal data (e.g., date of birth) out of mistrust and practically trusts only one caregiver – with significant impact on daily life and social contacts.","There are no anxious-worrying fears of illness or excessive monitoring of bodily processes; experienced interventions on the brain are described within the context of a delusion of influence, not as fear of being physically ill.",She explicitly denies specific fears such as of spiders or certain situations; no circumscribed phobic fears or phobic avoidance are reported.,"Intrusive content is experienced as voices and implanted thoughts from external forces (God, ""fallen ones from the Vatican""), not as one's own, senselessly recognized, repetitively intrusive obsessive thoughts; the act of hitting the book is experienced as a meaningful protective action inspired by God, not as an ego-dystonic compulsion.","No compelling, subjectively experienced nonsensical action impulses are described arising from within; action commands come from voices (imperative hallucinations) and are not experienced as one's own compulsive impulses.","Repetitive actions (e.g., hitting the book, rearranging furniture, tapping walls, covering electrical outlets) are experienced as meaningful protection within the context of the delusion and are not recognized as senseless or excessive; they serve the purpose of delusional experience, not as compulsive rituals.","No diffuse, content-wise still indeterminate anticipatory tension is described, but rather a developed delusion with clear content; there are no indications specifically pointing to a predominant delusional mood.","Real perceived content (e.g., statements by a television presenter, texts in grandmother’s song/prayer book, drawn cards) is interpreted as personal signs and divine commands. Everyday perceptions acquire a delusional self-referential special significance and are integrated into the delusional system, with marked impairment (behavior according to ‘signs,’ protective actions).",No suddenly and without external cause newly occurring delusional thought is described in the current period; the reported convictions have existed for a long time and are fixed (correspond more to delusional thoughts).,"Long-lasting fixed delusions: divine mission, being chosen/'blessed ones', existence of a group 'fallen by God' from the Vatican, technical surveillance through bugs/microphones and power outlets, thought withdrawal ('black hole') and thought insertion (Haribo, semolina pudding), special abilities (mind reading and sending).

A mental illness as the cause of the symptoms is not recognizably acknowledged, although she describes the effect of the medications on the voices. This results in a pronounced discrepancy with the medical disease model.","At the voices' instruction (""the voices said I should no longer go and pick up the injection""), the patient did not collect the required depot injection for about eight weeks, resulting in a significant deterioration. Currently, however, she is willing to resume medication and injection treatment, which is why the refusal is classified as moderate.","The patient lives alone, can cook, shop (goes to Kaufhof with a rollator), and only receives meals on wheels; the need for assistance with basic activities of daily living (dressing, personal hygiene, food intake) is not described."
