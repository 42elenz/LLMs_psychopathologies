Speaker_0: Have a seat over there on the chair.
Speaker_1: You know,
my daughter is the one who brought me here last night.
Speaker_0: Yes, look, you can put that down over there.
Speaker_1: I’m telling you, she’s just as stupid as my husband.
Speaker_0: Oh really?
Speaker_1: Yes.
Speaker_0: Please have a seat.
Speaker_1: Same stock.
Speaker_0: Same stock.
Speaker_1: Same stupidity.
Speaker_0: Oh.
Speaker_1: They have no sense of humor.
Speaker_0: Which you do have.
Speaker_1: Absolutely, of course. And they also don’t understand me. On top of everything.
Speaker_0: Before we start our conversation, Ms. Lange, just take a moment to look around. It’s a bit of an unusual situation here, right, with cameras and microphones.
Speaker_1: Yes, that doesn’t bother me. I like it.
Speaker_0: Has anyone explained to you why the two of us are sitting here with cameras and microphones?
Speaker_1: No.
Speaker_0: No? No. Well then I’d like to do that.
Speaker_1: Are you the doctor then?
Speaker_0: I’m a doctor, I’m a psychiatrist.
Speaker_1: Okay.
Speaker_0: And I’m not wearing a white coat, but you’ll just have to take my word for it.
Speaker_1: But your shirt is nicely ironed.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: Does your wife do that?
Speaker_0: Uh, we have someone who helps us with that at home.
Speaker_1: You have staff?
Speaker_0: Yes. But now I have to say one thing in advance. Um. The conversation we’re having here is being recorded. It’s being recorded for teaching purposes and for research purposes. And… you need to know that this conversation is not for the public, it’s not a public recording, the rules of medical confidentiality apply here just as in any other conversation.
We have about half an hour, and we’d like to talk about how you’re doing at the moment.
Speaker_1: Well, I’m feeling fantastic, so I really don’t understand why I’m here at all.
Speaker_0: Since when have you been here?
Speaker_1: Since last night.
Speaker_0: Oh, so very recent.
Speaker_1: My daughter just put me in the car and said, “Mother, we’re going.”
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: And stupid as I am, I actually went along, and now I’ve ended up here and can’t get out.
Speaker_0: So you’re not really in agreement with being here.
Speaker_1: Not at all.
Do you sail?
Speaker_0: No. No.
Speaker_1: Do you plan to sail?
Speaker_0: No.
Speaker_1: Does your wife sail?
Speaker_0: She doesn’t either.
Speaker_1: Your brother?
Speaker_0: Yes, he sails.
Speaker_1: Then I’ve got something for him.
Speaker_0: You’ve got something for me.
Speaker_1: Look, I’ve got a book here.
Speaker_0: Yes, about knots.
Speaker_1: About knots, yes.
Speaker_0: Ah yes.
Speaker_1: There’s a knot exercise in there.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: There’s a cord inside.
Speaker_0: Wonderful.
Speaker_1: Ah, now I’ve pulled it out, stupid.
Speaker_0: Well, that’s all right.
Speaker_1: Stupid.
Speaker_0: You can put it back in again, it’s not that bad.
Speaker_1: Yes, and then you can do it with your wife, your brother, you said.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: And where does he sail?
Speaker_0: I don’t really know exactly. He once sailed on the Baltic Sea. But, Ms. Lange, can we…
Speaker_1: Isn’t it too tight up there?
Speaker_0: No. No, it’s not too tight. Can we talk again about why you actually came to the clinic? I don’t understand it.
Speaker_1: I don’t understand it.
Speaker_0: You say you feel great, absolutely great. But your daughter thought something was wrong with you.
Speaker_1: Yes, I already told you, she’s just as stupid as her father.
Speaker_0: Yes. Yes. Yes.
Speaker_1: You know, my husband, you can hardly stand him anymore. He’s old, just sits in front of the TV, eats, gets fatter every day, and, um, do you know him too?
Speaker_0: Yes, Albert Schweitzer, yes.
Speaker_1: In our generation people still know him.
Speaker_0: They still know him then.
Speaker_1: He was a great man. Yes. And he was in Africa too, right?
Speaker_0: Yes, of course. He was in Africa. Exactly. As it says on the book.
Speaker_1: I’ve got big plans in Africa too.
Speaker_0: Yes? What do you plan to do in Africa?
Speaker_1: Build wells in the Sahara.
Speaker_0: Build wells in the Sahara. Yes. How deep do you have to drill?
Speaker_1: Well, I don’t know that yet. I’ve already thought you’d probably have to go quite deep. But three weeks ago I was…
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: I went by taxi to the Lüneburg Heath.
Speaker_0: That’s pretty far away though.
Speaker_1: Yes, it’s also dry there.
Speaker_0: Yes, but going there by taxi, how much did that cost?
Speaker_1: Oh, I won’t tell you that. No, no, no.
Speaker_0: That would be covered by my duty of confidentiality.
Speaker_1: No, no, no.
Speaker_0: All right, keep it to yourself.
Speaker_1: And then you’d tell others anyway. No, no, I won’t tell you.
Speaker_0: Yes, keep it to yourself.
Speaker_1: Besides, it’s nobody’s business.
Speaker_0: That’s true.
Speaker_1: Okay, and then I already, I’m telling you, I already brought him 2,000 euros. He wanted to build a prototype.
Speaker_0: Yes, for the pump in the Sahara.
For the pump in the Sahara.
Speaker_1: Wells, wells, not pumps.
Speaker_0: Yes, but you have to pump it up.
Speaker_1: There are these things, you know, if you, for example, if you hang a wick into a glass of water,
Speaker_0: yes,
Speaker_1: and there’s water in it and the wick goes down further,
Speaker_0: yes,
then the water comes out along the wick, you see, and that works in the Sahara too?
Speaker_1: We still have to try that out.
Speaker_0: You still have to try that out.
Speaker_1: And I’ve now, um, gotten to know Tom.
Speaker_0: Gotten to know whom?
Speaker_1: Tom.
Speaker_0: Tom. Yes, who is Tom?
Speaker_1: Tom is my new boyfriend.
Speaker_0: Ah, where is he from?
Speaker_1: From Algeria.
Speaker_0: From Algeria. So he’s a bit closer to the Sahara.
Speaker_1: Exactly.
Speaker_0: And he probably helps you with these…
Speaker_1: And he’s twenty.
Speaker_0: Twenty. And he helps you with these…
Speaker_1: And he acknowledges me.
Speaker_0: Yes, yes.
Speaker_1: And he also loves my body.
Speaker_0: Yes, well, and, and…
Speaker_1: My husband hasn’t for a long time, and I find his body awful too.
Speaker_0: And?
Speaker_1: He’s got hair everywhere.
Speaker_0: And how long have you known Tom?
Speaker_1: Do you need a tissue?
Speaker_0: No. How long have you known Tom?
Speaker_1: I’ve known Tom for two months now.
Speaker_0: Yes, and where did you meet him?
Speaker_1: Oh, look, my bag is coming apart.
Speaker_0: Ah, the…
Speaker_1: What do you think of that? There’s no quality anymore. No quality these days.
Speaker_0: Yes, the bottom. The bottom is a bit brittle.
Speaker_1: That’s a disgrace, isn’t it?
Speaker_0: The bag is probably a bit older.
Speaker_1: Well, how long have I known Tom? Two months, I said, right?
Speaker_0: Two months,
Speaker_1: yes.
Speaker_0: yes.
Speaker_1: Now I’ve spoken with his family. I don’t speak Arabic, but they speak a little French, a little. And I’ve already talked to them. I’ve now transferred 5,000 euros to them.
Speaker_0: That’s quite something, so 2,000 euros to the one in Lüneburg and now 5,000 to Tom.
Speaker_1: Do you know how big the Sahara is?
Speaker_0: I do, yes.
Speaker_1: You have to invest something.
Speaker_0: Yes,
uh-huh. And you took all that from your savings account?
Speaker_1: I took it all, yes. Yes, and also a bit from our joint account.
Speaker_0: Yes. What does your husband say about that?
Speaker_1: Oh, he’s stupid, he has no idea how important this is.
Speaker_0: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker_1: And I just let him grumble, you know, the old man, it doesn’t matter.
Speaker_0: But that it’s you of all people who are now going to drill in the Sahara, I do find quite remarkable.
Speaker_1: You know, I’ve known for quite some time,
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: that I’m something special.
Speaker_0: In what way?
Speaker_1: I was simply born for higher things. Now that really bothers me, though. This is outrageous, isn’t it?
Speaker_0: Well, you’ve swept it up nicely now and we’ll just leave it there.
Speaker_1: I did that nicely, didn’t I?
Speaker_0: Yes, you did that nicely.
And someone will clean it up later.
Speaker_1: You can see that I know how to make things look nice.
Speaker_0: Yes, yes.
Speaker_1: I was already in church, and then during the service I went up to the pastor.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: And he was preaching, and well, it was a bit boring, and then I said in front of the congregation that I think we should build wells in the Sahara.
Speaker_0: What did the pastor think of that?
Speaker_1: He sent me away. Hm. Uh-huh.
Speaker_0: And? Did you do that? Did you leave?
Speaker_1: Reluctantly.
Speaker_0: Reluctantly. But at least you did go.
Speaker_1: Yes, well, he was a bit forceful.
Speaker_0: Yes, okay.
Speaker_1: He almost laid hands on me.
Speaker_0: You just said you were…
Speaker_1: I’m from Feudenheim, you know.
Speaker_0: Where is Feudenheim? In the Palatinate Forest?
Speaker_1: No, it’s a suburb of Mannheim.
Speaker_0: Oh, I see.
Speaker_1: It’s a nice suburb.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: And it’s a nice church.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: And what I don’t understand is that the people there all have high school diplomas, there’s maybe one or two who aren’t academics, and none of them realized how important this is.
Speaker_0: Yes, you spoke of a calling, that you’re something special.
Speaker_1: Yes, yes.
Speaker_0: What kind of calling do you have?
Speaker_1: I have the calling, oh yes, about the wells, so I have the calling to make the world a bit better than it is.
Speaker_0: Yes, and where does this calling come from?
Speaker_1: From above.
Speaker_0: Yes, and how did you experience it?
Speaker_1: I just knew it, I had an inner certainty that it’s like that.
Speaker_0: Did you see any signs that told you this, or did you just know?
Speaker_1: I knew it, and then came a sign as well.
Speaker_0: Which one?
Speaker_1: Well, where is it now? Oh, look, this is great too.
Speaker_0: Let me ask again. When the sign came, you already knew, ah, King Ludwig. Yes, again: when the sign came, you already knew you were called. So that was more like a confirmation. Yes, and what was this sign?
Speaker_1: Two signs.
Speaker_0: Two even.
Speaker_1: And the third sign is, of course, Tom.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: Now there’s this junk all over from my damn handbag. If I’d known, I would have brought another one. There, look!
Speaker_0: Yes, what does it say?
Speaker_1: Namibia.
Speaker_0: Ah yes. Extreme droughts. And that was one of the signs,
Speaker_1: and the other sign…
Speaker_0: But you already knew you were called before that.
Speaker_1: Yes.
Speaker_0: You already knew.
Speaker_1: But then it became absolutely clear to me that it had to be about wells.
Speaker_0: That it had to be about wells. Yes. Uh-huh. Yes. And, um, I’d say it’s a huge project, 2,000 euros probably won’t be enough.
Speaker_1: Yes.
Speaker_0: How much will you need?
Speaker_1: Millions, probably.
Speaker_0: Millions.
Speaker_1: Millions.
Speaker_0: And where will you get that from?
Speaker_1: Well, I’ve now called Claudia Schiffer.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: She hasn’t replied yet.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: Then I emailed Apache.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: Then I emailed Xavier Naidoo. Okay, he’s a bit difficult at the moment, but I think he’s really waiting for an opportunity.
Speaker_0: Okay.
Speaker_1: Then I actually wanted to call Karel Gott, but I found out he has already died.
Speaker_0: Is he still alive?
I was just going to say, he’s not alive anymore.
Speaker_1: Oh well, he would have had a one-time chance to make up for that stupid “Maya the Bee” song. Well, whatever.
Speaker_0: That’s over.
Speaker_1: Then there’s Helene Fischer.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: I emailed her too.
Speaker_0: So you’re basically looking for sponsors?
Speaker_1: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It’ll be much better. Because I thought we’d put on a huge concert.
Speaker_0: Mhm.
Speaker_1: Here,
Speaker_0: yes.
Speaker_1: and maybe in Wembley Stadium?
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: And guess who’ll be the MC?
Speaker_0: Hansi Hinterseer?
Speaker_1: No, no, no.
Speaker_0: Florian Silbereisen?
Speaker_1: No! Me.
Speaker_0: Oh! Ah, yes. You’ll do it.
Speaker_1: I’ve already bought a dress too.
Speaker_0: Yes, that’s, uh…
Speaker_1: A really great one, with lots of rhinestones. Yes. And blue.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: But light blue, dark blue doesn’t suit me.
Speaker_0: Since when?
Speaker_1: Or do you think dark blue suits me? That’s too dark, right?
Speaker_0: I’d go for a medium blue.
I’d go for a medium blue.
Speaker_1: But now that I’ve got a young boyfriend, I have to…
Speaker_0: Now let me ask a bit more. These plans – how long have you had them, the ones with the Sahara? Since when is this going on?
Speaker_1: Well, for about… I’d say for two months.
Speaker_0: For two months.
Speaker_1: And before that I already felt very, very good.
But I didn’t yet know where to put my energy and my ideas. The people around me, my neighbors, they don’t understand it at all, and my husband doesn’t either.
Speaker_0: And your daughter doesn’t either.
Speaker_1: No.
Speaker_0: Yes. Right. And she’s the one who brought you to the clinic.
Speaker_1: They’re just stupid.
Speaker_0: Yes. Yes. Yes. So people don’t always, don’t always respond positively to you. They don’t always welcome it.
Speaker_1: No, not at all. We’ve already had arguments.
Speaker_0: I was just going to say, that can lead to conflicts.
Speaker_1: But not like…
Speaker_0: I mean, not with fists, but…
Speaker_1: but with…
Speaker_0: words,
Speaker_1: you do talk,
Speaker_0: yes,
Speaker_1: yes,
Speaker_0: yes,
Speaker_1: yes,
Speaker_0: yes,
Speaker_1: yes,
Speaker_0: and you can also get a bit irritated when there’s headwind, right?
Speaker_1: Yes, yes, yes, it’s outrageous, you know. When I’m working on my stuff at night, I need music too.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: And then everything goes much better, and then the neighbors complained.
Speaker_0: Oh, so they’ve already complained as well.
Speaker_1: Oh, they’re all such fine people, “fine people,” I say. Fine, fine, fine, fine. And, um, oh. Hope that doesn’t crush it.
Speaker_0: Yes. All right.
Speaker_1: I’ve got another sign.
Speaker_0: Another one.
Speaker_1: That was just the other day.
Speaker_0: Another newspaper article.
Yes, that was just the other day.
Speaker_1: Yes, I don’t really read the Mannheimer Morgen at the moment because… I’ve got too much on my mind.
Speaker_0: But there…
Speaker_1: There, there, there!
Speaker_0: There the ideas are probably just bubbling up – hot struggle with sand and sun. Your head must be bubbling over with ideas.
Speaker_1: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker_0: You have lots of ideas.
Speaker_1: Yes, I have lots of ideas. That’s exactly it. I have to organize everything. I have to organize the wells. Then I’ve, well, supported Tom’s family, right.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: They’re already looking for the hotels and everything.
Speaker_0: And you’re also supporting the family a bit with the 5,000 euros.
Yes.
Speaker_1: Yes.
Speaker_0: Is that mutual?
Speaker_1: That’s my wish in life, you know. And they can also see how great I am.
Speaker_0: Okay. Now your daughter brought you to the hospital last night. Yes. You really don’t like that.
Speaker_1: No, because I have so much to do.
Speaker_0: Yes. Is anyone actually forcing you to stay here?
Speaker_1: Yes, the door is locked.
Speaker_0: Is that allowed?
Speaker_1: I can’t get out.
Speaker_0: Oh. Uh-huh.
Speaker_1: Yes. They said I’m not allowed to leave.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: And I have so much to do.
Speaker_0: And have they, the doctors, have the doctors told you why you have to stay here?
Speaker_1: Oh, I’d rather not talk about that now.
Speaker_0: I really would like to talk about it, because…
It’s partly about that now too.
Speaker_1: Yes, some of it is none of your business either, right.
Speaker_0: Not everything, but it is about the question: do you have to stay here or do you not have to stay here?
Speaker_1: Well, I think I don’t have to stay here. I think I need to get on with my things.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: Should we make it smaller?
Speaker_0: No, best leave it like that.
Speaker_1: Don’t you have a trash can here?
Speaker_0: Yes, there’s one back there.
Speaker_1: Oh good.
Speaker_0: But we’ll do that later.
Speaker_1: We’ll do that later.
Speaker_0: We’ll do that later.
Speaker_1: We’ll do that later.
Speaker_0: Yes. Your mood is fantastic, if I understand correctly.
Speaker_1: Ah, super, super, super.
Speaker_0: Your drive is also working very well.
Speaker_1: I don’t need sleep anymore.
Speaker_0: Well, a little bit probably.
Speaker_1: Well, one or two hours.
Speaker_0: One or two hours, but that’s enough for you.
Speaker_1: Sometimes it just comes over me, yes, completely.
Speaker_0: And in the morning you get out of bed easily, even if you’ve only slept an hour.
Speaker_1: Oh yes, hello, oh yes, hello, oh yes.
Speaker_0: And during the day all the chores that need to be done, do they just flow?
Speaker_1: Oh no, I’m not interested in that at the moment.
Speaker_0: Oh, that doesn’t interest you so much anymore.
Speaker_1: You know, when you think about the Sahara, right?
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: Then you can’t think about dust. Well, okay, you can. It’s Sahara dust at the moment, right?
Speaker_0: And there’s the dust.
Speaker_1: You have it on your car, that’s another sign.
Sahara dust.
Speaker_0: Yes. Yes. Yes.
Speaker_1: You notice it too, you notice it too.
Speaker_0: Yes, but do you have any idea where this sudden calling is coming from?
One day you say…
Speaker_1: It’s just the way it is. One person has curls, the other doesn’t.
Speaker_0: Uh-huh. Yes. Okay. Well, in any case it’s been like this for some time now and you’re putting your ideas into practice, and that doesn’t suit everyone.
Speaker_1: No, it doesn’t suit people at all and I think that’s stupid too.
I sometimes feel a bit alone with it. Except with Tom.
Speaker_0: Yes, yes. But otherwise it’s not like that.
Speaker_1: Ah, the well builder from the Lüneburg Heath understands me too.
Speaker_0: But it’s not that you’ve withdrawn, when you say you sometimes feel a bit alone. On the contrary.
Speaker_1: Oh no, oh no.
Speaker_0: You have contact with many people now and have to do a lot.
Speaker_1: I’m very popular with men at the moment too.
Speaker_0: Mhm, yes.
Speaker_1: I think that’s great.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: I enjoy that.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: Because in reality I’m, well, I may be nearly 70, but inside I’m not.
Speaker_0: So you not only feel great, you feel young, physically…
Speaker_1: beautiful,
Speaker_0: physically fit, high-performing.
Speaker_1: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker_0: Are there ever, let’s say, when something goes wrong, sad moments?
Speaker_1: Not really, eh, I’m more, more angry when I’m not understood.
Speaker_0: Annoyed, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I can understand that.
Speaker_1: Why can you understand that? Does that happen to you too?
Speaker_0: Well, no, but I can relate to it, when you have good ideas and your head is full of plans.
Speaker_1: Has it never happened to you that you have good ideas and nobody understands them?
Speaker_0: Probably I never had such good ideas as you, with the Sahara.
Speaker_1: That’s possible, of course.
Speaker_0: Probably that’s it. Yes. Yes, you said there are conflicts, there are arguments, but no aggressive, no daily arguments.
Speaker_1: No, no, we don’t do that in Feudenheim.
Speaker_0: Well, but in your own four walls, do swearwords sometimes fly? Does that happen?
Speaker_1: Well… hm. Maybe at the dog.
Speaker_0: Okay, yes. You say you’re nearing 70. That’s an age when sometimes one thing or another starts to show physically. How is it with you? Any physical complaints?
Speaker_1: At the moment I have nothing at all.
Speaker_0: Is there anything else that diminishes with age?
Memory, concentration?
Speaker_1: No, no, no, no, no, no.
Speaker_0: Works fine?
Speaker_1: Oh yes, great.
Speaker_0: Better than before?
Speaker_1: Fantastic.
Speaker_0: Okay.
Speaker_1: At the moment it’s fantastic.
Speaker_0: May I do two or three little tests to convince myself how good you are, something for concentration or memory?
Speaker_1: I’ll ace them all.
Speaker_0: You’ll ace them all, yes.
Speaker_1: Absolutely, of course.
Speaker_0: Okay, then we’ll start with…
Speaker_1: But no idiot tests, right?
Speaker_0: No.
Speaker_1: No.
Speaker_0: No. Then we’ll start with… or I’ll tell you three words and you have to remember them. For a few minutes, I’ll ask again later. The three words are Oslo, 24, ashtray.
Please repeat them.
Speaker_1: Oslo, 24, ashtray.
Speaker_0: Exactly. Do the words mean anything to you? No, just like that.
Speaker_1: You see? You see, you have inspirations too.
Speaker_0: Yes, although I usually use this when I talk to patients.
Speaker_1: Because otherwise you’d forget them.
Speaker_0: Exactly. So Oslo, 24, ashtray.
Speaker_1: Exactly.
Speaker_0: And now we’ll do another task, this one is about concentration.
It’s a math exercise. Are you reasonably good at arithmetic, handling numbers? Not so good?
Speaker_1: No, that’s not really my thing.
Language is more my thing.
Speaker_0: Okay, then we’ll use the names of the months.
First just to see if the months work. Can you recite the twelve months?
Speaker_1: From the front or from the back?
Speaker_0: From the front.
Speaker_1: January, February, March, April, June – no, May. June, July. That’s nice, isn’t it?
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: Do you like that too?
Speaker_0: Yes, do you still know…
Speaker_1: Do you give your wife presents sometimes as well?
Speaker_0: I sometimes give…
Speaker_1: What do you give her?
Speaker_0: Which month were you on last?
Speaker_1: April.
Speaker_0: Yes, you were a bit further.
Would you like to try again from the beginning?
Speaker_1: Yes, I’ll do it again from the beginning. January, February, March, April, May, June, July… August.
Speaker_0: Yes, great.
Speaker_1: That’s enough, right?
Speaker_0: Well, there are still a few months missing for the year.
Speaker_1: Okay. September, October, November.
Have you seen the photos?
Speaker_0: Is there one missing?
Speaker_1: December.
Speaker_0: Okay.
Speaker_1: Have you seen the photos?
Speaker_0: No, not yet. You also offered to say them backwards before.
Can you try that? Starting with the last one.
Speaker_1: I’ll do that. December, November, September, August, June, May, April, February, January. Look, there you have it.
Speaker_0: That’s the Albert Schweitzer book. But let’s…
Speaker_1: Look, that’s how it could look in the Sahara.
Speaker_0: When the water is there.
Speaker_1: When the little wells flow. Yes. Yes. I also have…
Speaker_0: Do you still remember the three words?
Speaker_1: Ashtray.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: Oslo and 26.
Speaker_0: The number isn’t quite right, but almost.
Speaker_1: See, I told you.
Speaker_0: It was 24.
Speaker_1: It’s great here. Great, great, great.
Speaker_0: Yes. Do you sometimes have difficulties with orientation, knowing the exact date, or finding your way around Mannheim?
Speaker_1: Well, I don’t always know the date.
Speaker_0: Well think about it, think about it: what date is it today?
What day of the week is it?
Speaker_1: Today is Thursday.
Speaker_0: Right.
Speaker_1: Yes, I basically know that. The sixth.
Speaker_0: Yes. Yes. And?
Speaker_1: February.
Speaker_0: And?
Speaker_1: Twenty-five.
Speaker_0: Perfect, that’s exactly right. Where are we?
Speaker_1: That was good. In Mannheim. In Mannheim.
Speaker_0: And what building are we in?
Speaker_1: ZI,
Speaker_0: yes. It’s the ZI. Do you also know what the ward is called that you’re on?
But you’ve only just arrived.
Speaker_1: No, I don’t know that.
Speaker_0: You only got here last night.
Speaker_1: But I have something else. Yes. I brought some songbooks on purpose – oh shit, where is it, did I forget it? No.
Speaker_0: You can keep them for the Sahara.
Speaker_1: No, no, I wanted to see if there are fellow patients I can sing a bit with.
Speaker_0: Yes, you can try that and ask them.
Speaker_1: This is from my father-in-law. Yes, the Mundorgel, I know that. I know it.
Speaker_0: But the old one you probably don’t know, right?
Speaker_1: Probably I do, but…
Speaker_0: There’s some rubbish in it, sometimes you can’t believe it.
Speaker_1: Yes, yes. Maybe I don’t know it after all.
But I think people will like it.
Speaker_0: I just have to ask some standard questions now. Can we do that?
Speaker_1: Yes.
Speaker_0: A bit one after the other. Yes.
Speaker_1: Yes. Wir sind die Jungen, Herr und Gott, auf ewig dir verschworen.
Speaker_0: Okay, now it’s my turn. Has there ever been a time in your life when you were afraid, had anxieties?
Speaker_1: Uh, I don’t know fear.
Speaker_0: Has there ever been a time in your life when you were very suspicious? Thinking others might be plotting something against you?
Speaker_1: Oh. No, not really.
Speaker_0: Not that.
Speaker_1: Well, you never know, people are always gossiping.
Speaker_0: Yes, but that you really thought someone was following you, wanted to get at you or your life, that never happened. Ever had what we call perceptual disturbances?
Speaker_1: What is that?
Speaker_0: Well, that’s when people see or hear things that others don’t see or hear at all, that aren’t really there.
So, something like hallucinations.
Speaker_1: No, I don’t have that.
Speaker_0: Never had that?
Speaker_1: No, I don’t have that.
Speaker_0: Ever had the feeling that other people…
Speaker_1: Would it be better like this?
Speaker_0: No, that doesn’t work so well.
Speaker_1: Better on the bag?
Speaker_0: Better on the bag. …that other people can read your thoughts?
Speaker_1: No.
Speaker_0: Can influence your thoughts?
Speaker_1: They don’t need to read them. It’s none of their business.
Speaker_0: Never experienced anything like that?
Speaker_1: No.
Speaker_0: Yes. Ever…
Speaker_1: I don’t know that.
Speaker_0: Ever had the feeling that something was changing on your body?
Speaker_1: No.
Speaker_0: No. Always been the same.
Speaker_1: Yes, rather younger.
Speaker_0: Rather younger, and in particularly good spirits now.
Speaker_1: My daughter can barely stand it, you know.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: She’s approaching 50, you know? Yes. She can hardly bear it.
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: She now has to come to terms with the menopause.
Speaker_0: Yes. The plans you’re making involve large sums of money. Do you ever worry about money?
Speaker_1: No. What?
Speaker_0: Not a problem at all.
Speaker_1: No, we’ll soon have these big shows. Do you know Wembley Stadium?
Speaker_0: Well, from TV.
Speaker_1: It’s pretty dirty around it.
Speaker_0: I don’t know.
Speaker_1: You’d have to get a cleaning crew to clean it up first.
Speaker_0: Well, that can surely be arranged.
Speaker_1: Helene Fischer won’t go there if it’s so filthy dirty.
Speaker_0: Um. Because there are always conflicts and trouble and arguments at home – do you sometimes feel you’ve done something wrong?
Speaker_1: No.
Speaker_0: No.
Speaker_1: No.
Speaker_0: No.
Speaker_1: Why should I have done something wrong?
Speaker_0: Well, your daughter thinks it’s not quite okay.
Speaker_1: I
already told her she’s stupid.
Speaker_0: That she’s stupid, yes.
Speaker_1: She’s as dumb as her father.
Speaker_0: Yes. Hm? Yes. Um.
Speaker_1: Dumb.
And they’re not pretty either. Whereas you look better.
Speaker_0: Thank you.
Speaker_1: You can’t help that.
Speaker_0: You’re in the hospital now.
Speaker_1: Yes.
Speaker_0: Do you actually feel ill?
Speaker_1: No, exactly not.
Speaker_0: Not at all?
Speaker_1: Not at all. I don’t know why.
Speaker_0: And if the doctors tell you that you do have an illness…
Speaker_1: They could be wrong too, right?
Speaker_0: They could be wrong.
Speaker_1: To err is human.
Speaker_0: Can you imagine that the doctors might be right?
Speaker_1: Rather not.
Speaker_0: Rather not?
Speaker_1: Rather not.
Speaker_0: So no matter what they say now, you say: I feel absolutely great, so what’s the point of all this?
Speaker_1: Yes.
Speaker_0: Something like that? Yes.
Speaker_1: Yes. More or less.
Speaker_0: Are you getting medication here?
Speaker_1: Well, they’ve tried, but so far…
Speaker_0: You don’t want any. Because, for you, there’s no reason.
Speaker_1: I’m fine.
Speaker_0: Because you’re fine.
Speaker_1: I’m feeling fantastic.
Speaker_0: Fantastic.
Speaker_1: Do you know David Jones?
Speaker_0: No.
Is that who the bag is from?
Speaker_1: Yes. International…
Speaker_0: Well, then I’d choose another brand in future.
Speaker_1: I won’t take this crap again.
Speaker_0: No.
Speaker_1: We’ll see, when I go home, if I ever get out of here again, then it’ll be like Hansel and Gretel, the crumbs.
Speaker_0: Right.
Speaker_1: Since you mentioned Hansel and Gretel.
Speaker_0: And no one eats them.
Speaker_1: So everyone will be able to find me.
From here to Feudenheim.
Since you…
Speaker_0: just mentioned Hansel and Gretel: that’s a fairy tale, right?
Speaker_1: Yes.
Speaker_0: And there are also so-called proverbs.
Speaker_1: Yes.
Speaker_0: Proverbs also have a figurative meaning. There’s always something people want to say with them. I’ll tell you one or two proverbs and then I’d like you to explain to me what they actually mean.
Now I only just remembered one. The proverb is: “The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”
Speaker_1: Exactly what I wanted to say. My daughter and my husband, both stupid.
Speaker_0: Yes, and what does that proverb have to do with it?
Speaker_1: That both of them are stupid.
That the apple is like the tree, so the daughter is as stupid as the husband.
Speaker_0: Okay, as her husband.
Speaker_1: Exactly, that’s what I wanted to tell you.
Speaker_0: You see, you see, because you’re not far apart at all.
Speaker_1: How did you know that?
Speaker_0: Another proverb.
Speaker_1: That’s a well-known one too.
Speaker_0: Another proverb. Mhm. “Lies have short legs.”
Speaker_1: I have short legs.
Speaker_0: Yes, and what does the proverb
“Lies have short legs” mean?
Speaker_1: You don’t get far if you lie.
Speaker_0: Exactly, that’s the figurative meaning. Right.
Speaker_1: And “faith can move mountains.”
Speaker_0: Yes.
Speaker_1: What does that mean?
Speaker_0: That you can achieve a lot with faith. Well, um, you could probably tell me about your projects for a very long time.
Speaker_1: I’m looking forward to Helene Fischer.
Speaker_0: So, all in all.
Speaker_1: Even though she’s from Russia, you know? But that’s okay at the moment. Let’s not talk about politics.
Speaker_0: No, let’s not. All in all, I think I’ve understood what’s close to your heart.
Speaker_1: Yes, wells in the Sahara.
Speaker_0: Wells in the Sahara. But that’s the only project?
Or are there other projects too?
Speaker_1: No, there are basically two, right. The wells and this concert.
Speaker_0: Well, that’s basically for financing the wells.
Speaker_1: Exactly.
Speaker_0: Right, I understood that correctly. Yes. Okay. Good, is there anything important we’ve forgotten? Anything else you’d like to talk about?
Speaker_1: Hm. Have you ever been to Füssen?
Speaker_0: Yes, but not to Neuschwanstein.
Speaker_1: You can’t get in there anymore, can you?
Speaker_0: No, I don’t know. It’s so crowded. Yeah, it’s not worth it. Okay, good, then we’ll stop here.
Speaker_1: Yes, and I hope I can go home soon, because I really…
Speaker_0: I wish for you that you’ll soon…
Speaker_1: And in the meantime I’d like to sing a bit with the fellow patients.
Speaker_0: I’d ask them first whether they feel like it.
Speaker_1: Oh, you have to cheer them all up a bit. They just hang around like this. You really have to do something. That doesn’t work otherwise. The staff, the nurses, they don’t have time.
I’ll do it then.
Speaker_0: Okay, I wish you all the best for your time here. I wish you that you’ll be able to go home soon. But think about it again. Sometimes medication can be quite helpful so you can at least sleep. Because if you only sleep an hour at night, that doesn’t work out well in the long run.
Maybe think about it again, about maybe taking something just for sleep. Discuss it on the ward.
Speaker_1: But it’s boring on the ward, isn’t it? Then sleeping might not… Well, I’ll think about it.
Speaker_0: Discuss it again, okay?
Speaker_1: Yes, I’ll think about it.
Speaker_0: Good, then all that’s left is for me to thank you.
But one last question. At the beginning you didn’t know what all this was for. Do you remember?
Speaker_1: Yes.
Speaker_0: Then I explained it to you.
Speaker_1: Oslo.
Speaker_0: Yes, those were the three words. But why, no, why is all this being done? Explain that to me again.
Speaker_1: Well, sort of so that it’s for scientific purposes, right?
Speaker_0: Yes, that’s basically right. That hits the point. Yes,
Speaker_1: yes.
Speaker_0: I wish you all the best.
Speaker_1: Good thing I washed my hair yesterday.
Speaker_0: I wish you all the best. Pack your things again and then…
Speaker_1: Yes, but you should take that for your brother.
Speaker_0: I think that… Maybe you’ll have another chance, when the mood at home is better, to go sailing with your wife and husband.
How about that?
Speaker_1: Ah, my husband gets seasick on a boat, that’s no use.
Speaker_0: Then he can watch while you go sailing with your daughter. No, better keep it.
Speaker_1: What a shame.
Speaker_0: And I think my brother already has enough books about sailing and knots.
Speaker_1: You don’t know that.
Speaker_0: I’m guessing. Knowing him, that’s how it is.
Speaker_1: Okay, then I’ll just take it with me again.
Speaker_0: Ms. Lange, all the best.
Speaker_1: My pleasure, and all the best to you too. Were you… I’ll leave this outside now. You said you’d clean it up.
Speaker_0: We will.
Speaker_1: There.
I hope you have good staff.
Speaker_0: Are those books there?
Speaker_1: Oh yes, I almost forgot them. Right.
Speaker_0: The Mundorgel?
Speaker_1: Good, that’s…
Speaker_0: There’s still…
Speaker_1: Oh, my scarf.
Speaker_0: Yes, okay.
Speaker_1: And my bags.
Speaker_0: I wish you all the best.
Speaker_1: My pleasure.
Speaker_0: All the best. Bye.
Speaker_1: Bye.
