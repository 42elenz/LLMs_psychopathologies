Speaker_00: Hello.
Speaker_01: Hello.
Speaker_00: I’m Mr. Trabert.
Speaker_01: I’m Mrs. Weber.
Speaker_00: Ms. Weber, have a seat.
So. Hello, Ms. Weber. As we already discussed earlier, we’d like to record things today – our conversation. It’s for teaching purposes and for research purposes. Yes? Is that okay?
Speaker_01: I’ll try.
Speaker_00: Okay, great.
Speaker_01: There’ve already been a lot.
Speaker_00: Yes. Uh, Ms. Weber, you’ve been on the ward for three days now, at least that’s what I have written here, is that right?
Speaker_01: Should be three, I’ve kind of lost track of time.
Speaker_00: Okay, and what brought you to us, Ms. Weber?
Speaker_01: Well, that was… must have been two or three days ago.
Um, um… I couldn’t sleep at night, and then I, um… because in my apartment there are microphones in the wall.
Speaker_00: Microphones?
Speaker_01: Everywhere.
Speaker_00: Like the ones we have here now, or are they small microphones, what kind of microphones?
Speaker_01: You can’t see them from the outside.
Speaker_00: You can’t see them?
Speaker_01: They’re really small, like this maybe.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: Like little bugs.
Speaker_00: In the wall?
Speaker_01: They’re in the wall.
Speaker_00: And all over the apartment, or…?
Speaker_01: All over the apartment.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Yes.
Speaker_01: Yes. But especially in the bedroom.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: I only have two rooms.
Speaker_00: What do you think, who installed them there, or how did these microphones get into the wall?
Speaker_01: So, um…
well, it’s like this. Um, so, um… they’re the ones who fell away from God, from the Vatican.
Speaker_00: Mhm. They installed them?
Speaker_01: They installed them.
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: And they’re everywhere.
Speaker_00: Mhm. “Fell away from God” – who are they? I’ve never heard of that. What kind of group is that?
Speaker_01: That’s, like… they used to be in the Vatican, priests mostly, and then they broke away from God and fell out of the Vatican.
And now they’re traveling all over the world, but especially around me.
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: Yes.
And I’ve got the job of finding them and maybe exposing them. But I don’t know, I’ve had that assignment for a long time.
Speaker_00: Who gave you that assignment, the Vatican or this group?
Speaker_01: I think God.
Speaker_00: God. God directly.
Speaker_01: God directly.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: I had a sort of vision. That’s when I heard it. He spoke to me like to Mary.
And he said, um, you are chosen, and you are the “enlightened one”, and, um, bring them to me.
Speaker_00: How does he communicate with you? Do you hear him directly, do you hear him at night in dreams? Where do you hear God, where do you hear the voice?
Speaker_01: Well, I don’t hear God that often.
Speaker_00: How did he give you this assignment?
Speaker_01: I always have it with me.
But…
if you also belong to them now… to the ones who fell out of the Vatican…
Speaker_00: No, we’re here because we want to help you so that you don’t feel so persecuted by them anymore, okay?
Speaker_01: I’ve been here before,
quite often.
Speaker_00: When was the last time you were on our ward?
Speaker_01: About… maybe two years ago.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: But then, I don’t really remember that, my caregiver, Ms. Dierschke, brought me.
Because the voices were really bad then.
Speaker_00: And how did you come here this time? For what reason? So what happened, who brought you?
Speaker_01: I drew the card.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: And it spoke to me.
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: It said, yes… it said, “I am God.”
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: “And you have the assignment.” Mhm. And that’s why I always carry it with me.
Speaker_00: And that’s how God communicates with you, through the cards?
Speaker_01: Through the cards.
Speaker_00: Okay. Did you get them from a special place or from a special person?
Speaker_01: No, I just bought them once.
Speaker_00: Okay.
And you said you sometimes hear voices, not from God, but others. Is that right?
Speaker_01: Those are the godless ones,
the ones who fell from the Vatican.
Speaker_00: Okay. And they speak to you?
Speaker_01: They speak to me.
Speaker_00: How do they speak to you? What did you just point at?
Speaker_01: Power sockets.
Speaker_00: At the sockets?
Speaker_01: Power sockets.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: And they bug me through them too.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: And they come out of the sockets and then, um, sometimes it’s really bad, then I can’t sleep because they’re so loud.
And then I turn the music up loud. And then, um… but they insult me too.
Speaker_00: And these sounds, these noises or the speech – you hear them as speech, right?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: About how many people is that, what would you say?
Speaker_01: Sometimes it’s only two.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: And sometimes I think it’s a whole… like a choir almost, that many.
Speaker_00: Men and women mixed?
Speaker_01: Only men.
Speaker_00: Only men.
Are they familiar voices?
Speaker_01: I only know them from the socket.
Speaker_00: Okay.
You’ve never heard them anywhere else before. You wouldn’t say, that could be so-and-so? You haven’t…
Speaker_01: No.
Speaker_00: No.
Speaker_01: Yes.
It…
it could also be my landlord.
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: That I’ve heard him before.
Speaker_00: Through the socket?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Okay. Does he live in the same building as you or somewhere else?
Speaker_01: He’s somewhere else.
Speaker_00: He’s somewhere else? And then he would also belong to this organization?
Speaker_01: He would… I suspect he also belongs to them.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: That… yes, I have to say, that bothers me.
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: Because when the voices are a bit quieter and I put the music on loud, then… it’s somehow bearable. But when they keep getting louder, I can’t sleep at night and they talk to each other too.
Speaker_00: Do you also hear them outside of your apartment, for example now, here, through the sockets or something like that?
Speaker_01: Very quietly.
Speaker_00: Very quietly?
Speaker_01: They only whisper.
Speaker_00: Okay.
But right now too, at this moment?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: They say, “Don’t say anything. Don’t say anything. Say nothing. Say nothing.” But Ms. Dirschke, my caregiver – and I do trust her.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Mostly. She said I should say everything.
Speaker_00: Okay, very good.
Speaker_01: Yes. She stands by me.
I’ve had Ms. Dirschke for a long time.
Speaker_00: So the voices also talk to you directly. They give you… they give you instructions, so they tell you to do certain things, like you just said.
Speaker_01: Yes, yes.
Speaker_00: Okay.
And among themselves?
Speaker_01: They also say I should… I should go to Kaufhof and buy sweets and then eat them.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: But then Ms. Dirschke scolds me,
because I’m getting too fat.
Speaker_00: Do you follow that? Do you follow what the voices say or can you resist that quite well?
Speaker_01: I can…
last time, when I was here at the ZI, I could actually resist pretty well.
Speaker_00: Okay, very good.
Speaker_01: At the moment, not so much. Right now, not so much.
I have to eat a lot of sweets. I go to Kaufhof and they watch me and they check that I buy the right things.
Speaker_00: Yes, the landlord.
Speaker_01: They always want me to eat Haribo. Haribo.
Speaker_00: A particular kind, or…?
Speaker_01: Sour ones.
Speaker_00: Sour ones. Okay.
Speaker_01: I don’t even like them that much, but they always say, “Buy sour ones from Haribo, buy sour ones from Haribo.”
Speaker_00: Yes.
Your landlord, you said he might be involved too, somehow entangled in this. Um, does he, or does this group, want to do something bad to you? What do they want from you? Why do you think they’re following you?
Speaker_01: They want… oh, what should I say now, should I say it, should I say it, I won’t say it, I won’t say it, I won’t say it, I won’t say it… I’ll say it, I’ll say it.
They want me not to talk about them.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: And they want me not to leave my high-rise apartment. And, um, sometimes they also want me to cook semolina pudding.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: Yes.
But then they muddle me up again through the socket. If I cook it for too long, they say, “Stop, don’t cook it that long, don’t cook it that long.”
That’s when they make a fool of me.
Speaker_00: You’ve been tapping on the book you brought with you now and then. What kind of book is that?
Speaker_01: That’s from my grandma.
“Alone to God in the highest be glory.”
Speaker_00: Is that a Bible or what kind of book is it?
Speaker_01: It’s a hymnbook. Sacred songs.
Speaker_00: Okay. You keep hitting on it like that. Does that help you? So why do you do it? What…?
Speaker_01: It distracts the voices. So when they come out of there – “Don’t say it, don’t say it, don’t say it” – and I do this…
then the voices go back there and then out again through the microphone.
Speaker_00: Okay, okay. And how often a day do you have to hit the book like that?
Speaker_01: It varies. I always have it with me.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: Because you never know. Then they sneak out again. And now I don’t have my sound mallets with me. I had to hand them in. So now I do it this way.
Speaker_00: Okay. And that protects you from the voices, so to speak?
Speaker_01: That protects me.
Speaker_00: If you didn’t do that, what do you think would happen then?
So what would happen if you didn’t knock them away?
Speaker_01: Uh, then I might be the “outsmarted one” (die Geschlaumeierte).
Speaker_00: Okay. What does that mean, “outsmarted”?
Speaker_01: That means that then I might… have to do something I don’t want to do. Wash my hair.
Speaker_00: Wash your hair? Okay.
Speaker_01: I don’t like doing that so much.
Speaker_00: Do you sometimes have the feeling that these voices, or this group, or other people can somehow pull thoughts out of you?
So that you have thoughts that then get taken out of your head?
Speaker_01: I won’t say it. I won’t say it. I won’t say it. I won’t say it.
I’ll say it. I’ll say it. Yes, sometimes they… it’s like a piece of the brain is taken out, and then there’s this black hole.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: And then they’ve taken my brain with the thoughts out.
But how they do that, I don’t know.
Speaker_00: Okay. Do you also have the feeling that they can put thoughts into you, that certain thoughts don’t just get told to you, but really implanted?
Speaker_01: Yes, that’s with the Haribo.
Speaker_00: Okay. And they don’t just say that to you, it’s like it’s implanted, mainly…
Speaker_01: It’s like, you know, when… there’s that examination where you get something on your head like a bathing cap.
Speaker_00: Mhm, EEG.
Speaker_01: Something like that, and there are little things in it and they shoot it into your brain and then it’s implanted.
Speaker_00: And they put that on you somehow, or…?
Speaker_01: They do that at night when you’re sleeping.
That’s why I mustn’t sleep.
Speaker_00: You said your sleep is bad, right?
Speaker_01: Yes, but I have to keep watch.
Speaker_00: How many hours would you say you sleep at night now?
Speaker_01: Since I’ve been here, it’s a bit better again.
Speaker_00: It’s gotten better?
Speaker_01: Yes. But, um…
about one, two hours.
Speaker_00: One, two hours?
Speaker_01: Then I sometimes have to move the furniture around. Because there might be bugs behind them too.
Speaker_00: You said, exactly, you said you have bugs at home too and you’ve searched for them when you say you move furniture?
Speaker_01: Yes, I hammered on everything with a hammer.
Speaker_00: Okay.
And did you find anything, or…?
Speaker_01: Yes, and then the police came.
Speaker_00: So that was when you…
Speaker_01: It would be good if someone could go there with me.
Speaker_00: And take a look at it?
Speaker_01: So they can have a look at it.
Speaker_00: You said you’ve been here with us before, right?
Speaker_01: Many times.
Speaker_00: Many times, yes?
In between it was better at some point, right? You didn’t come to us for quite a while.
Speaker_01: Yes, back then… yes, then it was better.
Speaker_00: What do you think changed? Why has it gotten worse again now?
Speaker_01: I won’t say it, I won’t say it. The voices said I shouldn’t go and get my injection anymore.
Speaker_00: Mhm. The depot injection?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: And then I thought, well,
then I won’t go anymore.
Speaker_00: Okay. How long have you not gone now?
Speaker_01: Eight weeks.
Speaker_00: And it got worse again that quickly.
Speaker_01: Yes, it did.
Speaker_00: You also said that there’s this communication.
Speaker_01: This here, for example, is
from July 25th, 1938.
Speaker_00: Aha, what is that? What have you brought there?
Speaker_01: “There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has torment.”
She’s just like me – everything is supposed to be driven out of me too.
Speaker_00: What do you think that means, what’s written there? Why do you think it’s about you? Could you explain that a bit?
Speaker_01: Because I
got it from my grandma.
Speaker_00: Okay, yes. And your grandma wanted to tell you something with it?
Speaker_01: I think so, yes.
Speaker_00: And what do you think it tells you?
Speaker_01: That I shouldn’t be afraid, and also to watch out that they… I could also tape up the sockets.
Speaker_00: Okay, have you ever done that?
Speaker_01: I’ve done that too.
Did it help?
At the beginning.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Apart from that, you said you got this assignment from God – to wipe out this group.
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Why do you think you got this assignment? What makes you the one who’s suited to do that?
Speaker_01: Because I’m the “blessed one” (die Gebennedeite).
Speaker_00: Okay. What does that mean?
I’m not that familiar – what does “gebennedeit” mean? What would you say?
Speaker_01: It means…
chosen.
Speaker_00: Chosen?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Just like it says here, “the overflowing fountain.”
Speaker_00: And why do you think you were chosen?
Do you have any special powers that other people don’t have?
Speaker_01: Because I
bought this card.
Speaker_00: Because of the card?
The one where God spoke to you and said you have to…
Speaker_01: Yes, that’s how it is.
Speaker_00: And do you have any special powers you can use against this group that other people don’t have?
Speaker_01: Well, I won’t say it, I won’t say it, I won’t say it… I can’t… I’m very focused, right now it’s a bit difficult, I can sort of… the thoughts from my head, they come out the front like this,
and
then I can put them onto others, and then they go into the other person’s head and then they’re in there, and then I can…
make them – I mean tell the thought or tell the other person over their head what they should do.
Speaker_00: So you can steer other people through that, so to speak. Can you also read other people’s thoughts? Do you know what other people are thinking?
Speaker_01: Sometimes yes.
Speaker_00: Do you see it only in their face what they might be thinking, or is it really that you can read their thoughts like a book, or that it gets transferred?
Do you actually hear the thoughts?
Speaker_01: I hear them. They
come into my head like this.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Then they’re in there.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: And then they speak from inside.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: Except when there’s that hole.
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: Sometimes there’s that hole when everything is taken away from me.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: And then I can’t hear them so well.
Speaker_00: This group – they must have installed everything at some point and maybe, as you said, your neighbor is also involved.
So, could you say a bit – how do you think they do all of this? How do they manage to install it, to get into your apartment? Do they have special connections with other institutions or how would you say it all fits together?
Speaker_01: I
think they have connections with the janitor.
Speaker_00: Mhm. Mhm.
Speaker_01: You mustn’t say that, then… then they eavesdrop on me again through these sockets and then they mess me up and then they set me off and then I go to Kaufhof and they say, “Buy gummy bears, buy gummy bears.” And then I buy gummy bears and when I come back they’ve done everything, and I think the janitor… and I also think the landlord, because he gave me gummy bears once.
I think they’re all in cahoots. And the janitor lets them in and then they cover all the walls.
Speaker_00: Okay.
And otherwise, what would you say – it sounds really frightening to me when I imagine that someone is constantly coming into my apartment. How do you feel about that? Are you afraid, or how would you describe it?
Speaker_01: It’s actually okay.
Speaker_00: Okay?
Speaker_01: It’s okay. Sometimes yes. Then I stay awake and keep watch.
Speaker_00: Yes. Yes, because you stay awake, right? Because you’re afraid they’ll steal your thoughts.
Speaker_01: Everywhere, yes. And so on.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: But the fear is manageable.
Speaker_00: Okay.
And what about your mood?
Speaker_01: A few years ago it was bad.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: I once had to run out of the apartment.
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: And I took all my clothes off and screamed.
And then I ended up back here again.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: Yes.
Yes.
But now it hasn’t been that bad.
Mhm.
Speaker_00: Yes. And otherwise, emotionally – would you say you feel sad, happy, neutral right now? How would you describe how you feel at the moment?
Speaker_01: Actually, uh, maybe not really anything.
Speaker_00: Not really?
Speaker_01: Neither nor.
Speaker_00: Neither nor. So more neutral?
Speaker_01: Yes, yes, neither.
Speaker_00: Okay. And you said that your head is sometimes completely empty. How would you describe your thoughts at the moment? If you had to say it’s like a river – does it flow along normally, gently at a normal pace, or would you say it flows very slowly, thickly, or that the thoughts just rush by?
What would you say your stream of thought is like right now?
Speaker_01: So at the moment it’s rather a bit too slow.
Speaker_00: Slow?
Speaker_01: Slow.
Speaker_00: Do you forget a lot of things? Do you feel like you forget a lot?
Speaker_01: What do you mean?
Speaker_00: That you forget things.
Speaker_01: What do you mean by that?
Speaker_00: For example, that you simply forget what you were just talking about, or that you keep misplacing your keys, that you forget lots of things you were just thinking about and suddenly they’re gone?
Speaker_01: Yes, that…
that happens sometimes.
Speaker_00: Okay. I’d like to do a little test, since we were just talking about how your thoughts are. I’d like to ask you to remember three words.
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Okay. And just repeat them after me, and I’ll ask you again about them later.
The first word is Oslo.
Speaker_01: Oslo.
Speaker_00: Ashtray.
Speaker_01: Ashtray.
Speaker_00: Very good. And 32.
Speaker_01: 34.
Speaker_00: 32.
Speaker_01: 32.
Speaker_00: 32. Can you repeat all three words again?
Speaker_01: 32 or was it 34?
Speaker_00: 32.
Speaker_01: 32. Oslo and…
ashtray.
Speaker_00: Very good. I’ll ask you about those three words again later. Now, back to concentration. I’d like to ask you to subtract seven from a hundred, over and over.
Speaker_01: Now you’re muddling me up again.
Speaker_00: Are they saying something right now?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Can you still concentrate on the task I’m about to give you? Shall we try?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Okay. So, from 100 keep subtracting 7, and keep going. You probably know this task already, you’ve been here a few times before. Can you do it once?
Speaker_01: 100 minus 7 is 93. Minus 7 is 86. Minus 7 is 70. 70 is actually 10. There’s the 7. Oh, now I’ve lost the thread.
Speaker_00: Not a problem at all.
Start from 70 now. It doesn’t matter. Start from 70 and keep subtracting 7.
Speaker_01: Because 70 already has the 7 in it.
Speaker_00: Exactly, it’s in there too. That makes it a bit easier.
Speaker_01: Yes, 70 minus 7 is… 63 minus 7 is 5… 5, or 5 or 6, no, it was 58. Oh, now I can’t anymore.
Speaker_00: Not bad at all, really not.
Speaker_01: I can’t anymore.
Speaker_00: That’s fine. You read the Bible, and there are a lot of, let’s say, parables in there.
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Yes, and you’ve just read something. What do you think, for example, the saying “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth” means?
Speaker_01: Maybe that you should clean your teeth.
Speaker_00: Okay, okay. I’ve got another one: “The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.” What could that mean?
Speaker_01: Maybe eat more applesauce.
Speaker_00: Okay, yes. Can you imagine any other meaning it could have?
Speaker_01: That the apple might be lying in the grass.
Speaker_00: Okay, yes, good. That fits, right? You can also say it means that parents and children are similar, right? Because the tree is where the apple comes from, that’s where it grows.
Does that also make sense to you, that one could say it like that?
Speaker_01: No, not really.
Speaker_00: Not really?
Speaker_01: No.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Um, then I have another question. Do these voices also tell you to hurt yourself? Has that ever happened?
Speaker_01: So, what?
No, not really.
Speaker_00: Not really?
Speaker_01: I have hurt myself, though.
Speaker_00: You hurt yourself?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: How?
Speaker_01: But more because I’m a bit clumsy.
Speaker_00: Okay, what happened?
Speaker_01: Well, once, when I was hammering on the wall, I had my hand in between and hit my hand with the hammer,
that was stupid.
Speaker_00: It wasn’t on purpose?
Speaker_01: I don’t really think so.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: But what they do say is that I should eat more.
Speaker_00: Eat more.
Speaker_01: And Ms. Dirschke said I’m getting too fat.
Speaker_00: Do they also tell you that you shouldn’t tell certain people things? And do they also tell you to hurt other people?
Speaker_01: No, they don’t say that.
Speaker_00: Okay.
And about yourself – you said you once hit your hand, but you’ve never deliberately hurt yourself?
Speaker_01: No, that’s true.
Speaker_00: And do you yourself have thoughts about maybe not wanting to live anymore?
Speaker_01: No, because I’m not allowed to, that’s what Ms. Dürschke said.
Speaker_00: Okay, okay. And if Ms. Dürschke says that, you accept it like that? Then…
Speaker_01: If Ms. Dürschke says so, then I do that.
Speaker_00: Oh, great. Very good. Okay. You really trust her a lot, don’t you? Ms. Dürschke.
Speaker_01: Ms. Dürschke. Although sometimes I’m a bit… but…
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: You have to trust someone.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Otherwise I’m completely alone.
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: You currently live alone in this two-room apartment, right? That’s what you said?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Yes. Do you have family?
Speaker_01: They’re all dead.
Speaker_00: They’ve all died?
Speaker_01: I still have a brother, but he’s in America.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: I don’t know where he is.
Speaker_00: And you don’t have children?
Speaker_01: I don’t have children.
Speaker_00: Okay. Husband, partner?
Speaker_01: I never had one. I had a few men in the past, but…
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: That’s…
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: They only came when they wanted money.
Speaker_00: Hm. Yes.
Speaker_01: That’s what I had.
Speaker_00: What was your last job?
Speaker_01: Oh, that was a long time ago. Forty years.
Speaker_00: Forty years. What did you do?
Speaker_01: I was a shop assistant. Saleswoman. At Kaufhof.
Speaker_00: Okay. Good.
Speaker_01: Oh, wrong hand.
Speaker_00: Can you still remember the three words I gave you?
Speaker_01: What was it… it was some city.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Bonn?
Speaker_00: No, another country.
Speaker_01: Oh, I’ve never traveled. I was once in Lloret de Mar. By bus. Um, Bonn, another city… I can’t think of it.
Speaker_00: Okay, Oslo?
Speaker_01: Ah, Oslo. Yes, Oslo.
Speaker_00: What else was there?
Speaker_01: Now I knew it… yes. Ah, yes. Then it was… I know the number, it was 43.
Speaker_00: Yes, almost.
Speaker_01: What could it be… 34… yes,
Speaker_00: It was 32, right? But you had 34 in mind earlier, we got a bit mixed up. Exactly, and the last one was an object.
Yes, what do we need for smoking, for tapping off the ash? Where do you tap the cigarettes?
Speaker_01: Lighter.
Speaker_00: Yes, a lighter too. Where do you tap the cigarettes, the ash? Yes.
Speaker_01: Ashtray.
Speaker_00: Ashtray, very good.
Speaker_01: Ashtray.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: Ashtray.

Speaker_00: Good, we’ve talked a lot about your thoughts now, about them wanting to do something bad… You said the sockets are a channel for communication – is it also the case that sometimes the newspaper, the TV and such are used as communication channels? Some patients tell me that. Is that the case for you too, or…?
Speaker_01: TV, yes, sometimes.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: But more like… that this Frauke Ludowig, or what’s her name, that presenter – sometimes she says something and then I think, that’s a sign. And they don’t speak from the radio. But there are a lot of sockets. Look, you already have…
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: That’s enough, actually.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: You already have them there.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: Now he’s quite busy eavesdropping.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: You’re messing me up.
Speaker_00: I have another question.
Speaker_01: You’re chewing on me.
Speaker_00: Yes.
I have another question about hitting the Bible. That… uh… right, that helps you. Do you feel like the idea to do that, so that nothing bad happens and so you don’t have to buy Haribos, comes from you yourself, or is that also an implanted thought? Or is it your own thought?
Speaker_01: I think it
comes from God.
Speaker_00: It comes from God?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Okay. Okay, and you like it?
Speaker_01: Because God helps me out of all distress.
Speaker_00: Okay, but you do feel that you want to follow that. So you feel it’s a good thought that comes, that it comes from God and that’s why you want to follow it.
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Okay. If you can, you must, but you want to – you don’t fight it, you enjoy doing it, right? You like hitting it.
Speaker_01: I like doing it.
Speaker_00: Exactly, because it helps you.
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Yes, okay.
Well, I’d say I’ve already asked very many important questions. Let me just quickly think if there’s anything else.
Do you have any other fears? Some people are afraid of spiders or of heights. Do you have such fears?
Speaker_01: No.
Speaker_00: No.
Speaker_01: No.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: I’m not afraid.
Speaker_00: Good.
Speaker_01: No, maybe… no, not of spiders or anything.
Speaker_00: Do you sometimes feel as if reality is different somehow – that it loses its color, that it loses its outlines?
Speaker_01: I
think lately it’s become a bit
duller.
Speaker_00: Duller?
Speaker_01: Duller.
Speaker_00: Okay. Can you describe that? What does duller mean?
Speaker_01: Like when your glasses aren’t clean.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Okay.
Yes, I almost wanted to check mine.
Speaker_01: It’s
somehow duller. Like if the corners weren’t sharp but shrunk.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: The ceilings have shrunk too, everything is shrunk, shrunk and a bit gray.
Speaker_00: You said you haven’t taken your medication for quite a while now. Is it okay for you here on the ward to start taking the medication again and for us to order this injection again? And give it to you again?
Speaker_01: Yes, that can be done.
Speaker_00: Yes. Do you feel like this injection helps you somehow?
Speaker_01: Well, you really do have to say the voices are quieter then.
Speaker_00: They’re quieter, mhm.
Okay.
Speaker_01: And I don’t have to follow them all the time.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: When I take the tablets, or the injection. Right now I’m getting tablets.
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Do you have hope that the voices will get better again?
Speaker_01: Yes, that’s been my whole life.
Speaker_00: You already know that, right?
Speaker_01: I know it.
Speaker_00: Sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s worse. Yes. It always fluctuates. Mhm. Good.
Speaker_01: You also have to say, when I’ve been here for a while, then I sometimes think the ones who fell from God out of the Vatican…
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: They must be a bit stupid too.
Speaker_00: Why?
Speaker_01: Otherwise they would have done something to me by now.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Or if they can talk to me everywhere, then… but I only start thinking that after I’ve been here for a while. Then I think they’re a bit stupid. A bit stupid, stupid.
Speaker_00: Do you actually still have acquaintances and friends?
Speaker_01: Not really.
Speaker_00: Not really?
Speaker_01: No, not really.
Speaker_00: Yes, okay. Who do you still interact with? Are there still people?
Speaker_01: With Ms. Dierschke.
Speaker_00: With Ms. Dierschke. Okay. With Ms. Dierschke. Have you withdrawn from her recently? Have you become more suspicious there too?
Speaker_01: But she always calls.
Speaker_00: She always calls you proactively?
Speaker_01: Yes, she always calls.
Speaker_00: Do you have any leisure activities you do? What does a normal day look like for you?
Speaker_01: Sometimes I cook something for myself.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: And then I go to Kaufhof, get gummy bears, and I also get Meals on Wheels.
Speaker_00: Okay.
And has that become less – that you can’t cook for yourself anymore, or that you don’t go to Kaufhof as often?
Speaker_01: I’ve gotten old, too, you know?
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: I’ve gotten older.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: But now I have a walker,
so that works.
Speaker_00: Okay. Good, and then I have a few more silly questions at the end. Can you tell me where you’re living right now?
Speaker_01: At Jungbuschstraße 3.
Speaker_00: Okay.
Speaker_01: I know that, I’ve lived there for 40 years now.
Speaker_00: Yes, yes, that’s correct, that’s what I have here too… Do you know your date of birth?
Speaker_01: Yes, I know that too, but I’d rather not tell you.
Speaker_00: Okay, why?
Speaker_01: Oh, then… you know… maybe in two weeks.
Speaker_00: Okay, what will be different in two weeks?
Speaker_01: Maybe I’ll have calmed down a bit.
Speaker_00: Okay, and how old are you? Can you tell me that?
Speaker_01: 69.
Speaker_00: 69, okay, very good. Okay, and where we are right now, you know that, you already said it.
Speaker_01: Yes, I know…
Speaker_00: ZI. Good.
Speaker_01: I’ve been coming here a long time.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Since ’76.
Speaker_00: Good, from my side I actually don’t have any more questions. I think I have a pretty good understanding of what this is about right now. Is there anything else you’d like to share with me, that you really want to tell me?
Speaker_01: Yes,
whether Ms. Dösch would come so I can go buy gummy bears with her.
Speaker_00: Gummy bears? And is that coming from you now with the gummy bears, or is that again because of the bad ones?
Speaker_01: That’s coming from me now, and
sometimes I do quite like eating them.
Speaker_00: So sometimes you really like them yourself?
Yes.
Yes, okay. Yes, we can talk about that, right? You’ve already been here a while now, and that’s good.
Everything’s fine, yes? Yes. Good, then thank you very, very much. I’ll walk you out. Thank you for taking part. Very kind. Yes.
