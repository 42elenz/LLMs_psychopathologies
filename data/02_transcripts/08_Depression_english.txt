Speaker_00: Please have a seat.
Speaker_01: Oh, I’ve also got it in my hip.
Speaker_00: Yes, before we begin our conversation, just take a look around. This is surely a rather unusual situation for you as well, with camera, speakers.
Speaker_01: That doesn’t interest me.
Speaker_00: Yes, yes. Has anyone explained to you why we’re sitting here with a camera and microphone? Do you know? No? Then I’ll briefly explain it again. So, this conversation we’re having now is… a kind of initial interview. It will be recorded and is intended to be used for teaching and research purposes. So it’s not for the public, it won’t be shown on television or in the cinema, and what we discuss here is just as much subject to medical confidentiality as any conversation you have on the ward.
Yes? We have about half an hour, three quarters of an hour, and I’d mainly like to talk about how you are feeling now. So not so much about your life and what happened before, but about what your current problem is and why you are here in the clinic. All right? If there’s anything you don’t want to talk about, just say so and we’ll move on to another topic.
Agreed? Good. You haven’t been in the clinic very long, I think. How long?
Speaker_01: Three days now.
Speaker_00: Three days, yes.
Speaker_01: I was at my GP’s practice.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: And he said I had to come here straight away.
Speaker_00: And why did he say that?
Speaker_01: I’m just in so much pain, you know?
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Hip.
Speaker_00: In the hip.
Now, do you know which clinic you’re in here?
Speaker_01: Yes, I do.
Speaker_00: What kind of clinic is it?
Speaker_01: It’s for the soul.
Speaker_00: It’s for the soul and not really for the hip. Why did your GP send you to the clinic for the soul, the Central Institute?
Speaker_01: I just felt so bad at home. Really bad.
Speaker_00: And it wasn’t just the hip pain, there were other things as well.
Speaker_01: Yes. Yes.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: There were.
Speaker_00: And you were worried, had heartache?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Yes. Can you tell me what was causing you distress?
Speaker_01: I just couldn’t go on. I couldn’t go on.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: I just, just couldn’t go on.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: I can’t sleep.
Speaker_00: Yes. Since when has that been going on?
Speaker_01: About half a year.
Speaker_00: For that long already.
Speaker_01: But now it’s gotten really bad. It’s become really bad.
Speaker_00: Yes, yes. And when you say, “I can’t go on,” what does that mean? What is it that you can’t do anymore?
Speaker_01: Shopping. Because of the hip.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Can you do your housework? I don’t know, are you working?
Speaker_01: I don’t work anymore.
Speaker_00: You’re at home as a housewife, living alone or married?
Speaker_01: Alone.
Speaker_00: Alone. Can you still manage your housework? Are you unable to do it at all, or does it just take more effort?
Speaker_01: I have no strength.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: I just have no strength.

[Missing text.]

Speaker_00: That means getting yourself going doesn’t really work either.
Speaker_01: Not at all.
Speaker_00: The energy is gone.
Speaker_01: I prefer to stay on the sofa.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Watching TV isn’t fun either.
Speaker_00: Yes. And your mood – which word would you use to describe your mood?
Speaker_01: I don’t have any mood at all.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Is there still anything at all you can take any pleasure in, even a little bit? Nothing at all anymore?
Yes. And how does it feel inside you? Is there restlessness or is there emptiness too?
Speaker_01: Both.
Speaker_00: Both, yes, yes, that’s possible. How strong is the inner restlessness?
Speaker_01: Sometimes I think I’m going to burst, even though there’s nothing inside.
Speaker_00: Yes, and does that sometimes show on the outside as well? There are people who, when they’re restless, walk back and forth from one room to another.
Speaker_01: I don’t notice it.
Speaker_00: You sit on the, on the couch.
Speaker_01: I sit on the sofa, yes. I prefer to lie down.
Speaker_00: Yes. And are you brooding a lot?
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Yes. Are you worrying?
About specific things? About what?
Speaker_01: About my future.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: That I won’t be able to anymore.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: That I’ll have to go into a nursing home.
Speaker_00: Hm.
Speaker_01: Because I can’t manage anything anymore.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: I can’t take care of myself anymore.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: It’s all too much.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Everything’s neglected.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: The household, everything, everything’s nothing. I can’t cook anymore.
Speaker_00: Now you’re in the hospital. Your GP admitted you.
Can you imagine that you’ll get well again?
Speaker_01: Well,
rather not, but… My GP said it could get better again.
Speaker_00: He gave you a bit of hope.
Speaker_01: And I trust him, I’ve had him for a long time. My husband went to him too. He died two years ago.
Speaker_00: Are there other worries you have as well?
Speaker_01: Mainly about the future and how I’m going to manage it.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: If I can’t manage my household anymore, if I can’t manage at all, I’ll have to go into a home. And I don’t have that much money either.
Speaker_00: So you’re worried about money too?
Speaker_01: Well, if I have to go into a home, yes. As it is now, it’s okay.
Speaker_00: It’s still okay now, but in the future it could get tight.
Speaker_01: But if I have to go into a home.
Speaker_00: Yes. Are you worried about your physical condition?
Speaker_01: Oh, my hip, that too, yes. But it’s… well, I’m just getting older.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: I just can’t do it anymore.
Speaker_00: But does your physical condition scare you as well?
Speaker_01: Not really.
Speaker_00: Not so much.
Speaker_01: Not really.
Speaker_00: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker_01: Not so much. Because I’m actually not old. Not old enough for a home.
Speaker_00: Yes, how old are you, if I may ask?
Speaker_01: I’m turning 70.
Speaker_00: You’re turning 70, yes, that’s still young.
Are there any things where you feel you did something wrong?
Any things you feel guilty about?
Speaker_01: No, I just did everything as well as I could.
Speaker_00: Yes, you did that quite well.
Speaker_01: I was always active.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: But now…
Speaker_00: Do you have any explanation as to why you’re feeling so bad now?
Speaker_01: No, because actually, well, the hip maybe.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: And, you know, when my husband died…
At first I managed, because it was exhausting, you know? At first it was okay, but then…
then I did fall into a hole.
Speaker_00: Yes. Now your husband died two years ago and you say it’s been half a year that you’ve been feeling this bad. So there was a time in between when you felt better.
Speaker_01: When it was okay, when it was okay. At least I could still do my household.
Speaker_00: Okay, and that’s not possible anymore now.
Speaker_01: That’s not possible at all.
Speaker_00: How about contact with other people? Do you still have just as much contact with others?
Speaker_01: Not at all anymore.
Speaker_00: Why not?
Speaker_01: I don’t like talking to anyone.
Speaker_00: You don’t like to.
Speaker_01: I don’t like it.
Speaker_00: Do the others still ask how you’re doing?
Speaker_01: Not anymore now either.
Speaker_00: But it was
Speaker_01: I don’t answer the phone anymore either.
Speaker_00: you who withdrew.
Yes.
Speaker_01: Yes, you have to admit that.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: It was too much for me. I don’t like strangers.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Well, they’re not really strangers but…
Speaker_00: Mhm.
Speaker_01: I keep thinking of my cousin.
Speaker_00: What about your cousin?
Speaker_01: He hanged himself.
Speaker_00: Yes. Those are thoughts that can come up when someone has been feeling very bad for a long time.
Speaker_01: And I keep thinking he’s got it good, it’s over for him. He doesn’t have to struggle anymore, he doesn’t have to go into a home, he’s done.
Speaker_00: And do you sometimes think that this could also be a way for you?
Speaker_01: I don’t want to talk about that now.
Speaker_00: Yes, I can understand that on the one hand, but on the other hand it’s very important for the treatment.
Because many people have such thoughts, but how pressing they are…
Speaker_01: Well, to be honest, that’s why my GP sent me here.
Speaker_00: That was the reason, yes, because you told him about it.
Yes.
And when you have these thoughts, do you also have very concrete ideas about how it could happen, how you could do it?
Would you tell me?
Speaker_01: I still have tablets from my husband.
Speaker_00: Yes.
And they would be enough to kill yourself?
Speaker_01: I think so, I think so.
Speaker_00: What stopped you?
Speaker_01: I think my GP actually stopped me. But maybe there is also something inside me, because I do have a son and grandchildren.
Speaker_00: Yes, yes. Have you had contact with them recently?
Speaker_01: Yes, but more superficially. He’s busy too, you know.
Speaker_00: How old is your grandchild?
Speaker_01: My grandchildren are both ten.
Twins.
Speaker_00: That’s an age where children can sometimes be quite funny.
Speaker_01: Yes, but I can’t tolerate it.
Speaker_00: Can you still take an interest in that?
Speaker_01: No, not at the moment.
Speaker_00: It just passes you by?
Speaker_01: Yes, no. It gets on my nerves when they’re loud.
Speaker_00: It even gets on your nerves.
Speaker_01: I can’t stand it.
Speaker_00: Would you say that you…
Speaker_01: And I’m ashamed of that too.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: You know, I’m so ashamed. Because I’ve changed so much. And because I’ve become so neglected. Because I can’t stand my grandchildren. And because the household is so… oh, I’m really ashamed.
Speaker_00: Yes. When you said earlier that you sometimes can’t stand your grandchildren…
Are there also situations where you can react irritably because everything is so miserable?
Speaker_01: That can happen.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Yes,
but
it doesn’t help anyway.
Speaker_00: No, it doesn’t help us. Yes.
The fears you have – how strong are they?
Speaker_01: You mean fear of the future?
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: They’re just always there.
Speaker_00: Always there.
Speaker_01: Always there.
Speaker_00: They hurt.
Speaker_01: I keep thinking,
I can’t think of anything else. I keep thinking, what’s going to become of me, what’s going to become of me.
Speaker_00: If you imagine a scale from 0 to 10. 0 means no fear at all and 10 means very severe panic. How high is your fear?
Speaker_01: Seven.
Speaker_00: Seven.
Speaker_01: Seven.
Speaker_00: Yes. You said earlier that the fear is so strong that sometimes you can’t really think straight.
Speaker_01: I just keep thinking about it.
Speaker_00: Because you keep thinking about it. Yes, I keep thinking about it. So it’s a kind of brooding.
Speaker_01: Yes, and about what I can’t do and what I maybe will never be able to do again.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: I’ll never be able to cook again, never meet friends again, I don’t have any anymore either.
Speaker_00: And the thoughts just go around in circles.
Speaker_01: Always in circles, always in circles.
Speaker_00: Is your thinking slower than usual or just as quick?
Speaker_01: Hard to say, because I’m always thinking the same thing.
Speaker_00: Is it harder to think anything at all, so to speak?
Speaker_01: Well, I can’t read or anything.
Speaker_00: No? Yes. Concentration is also very bad.
Speaker_01: No, I can’t.
Speaker_00: Yes? Really?
Speaker_01: Yes, I can’t concentrate.
I can’t really watch TV either.
Speaker_00: Yes, yes. Would you agree if I did one or two small tests to check concentration and memory?
Speaker_01: Yes, I just hope you don’t find out I have dementia as well.
Speaker_00: That can all be examined and you’ll get a very sound answer about that.
Speaker_01: Go ahead.
Speaker_00: Let’s start with a concentration task. You know the twelve months of the year. Can you tell them to me?
Speaker_01: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December.
Speaker_00: Very good, that was completely correct. Exactly, yes. Would you have expected that, or would you have thought you’d do much worse?
Speaker_01: Worse.
Speaker_00: Shall we try to see whether you can also say them in reverse order? Starting with the last one and going back to the first?
Speaker_01: But that already takes a lot out of me.
Speaker_00: I believe that. Do you still want to try?
Speaker_01: I’ll try. And if I get it wrong?
Speaker_00: That doesn’t matter.
Not a problem at all.
Speaker_01: December, November, September, August, August. You see, now it’s coming back into my head again: what will become of me?
Speaker_00: Yes, it is really hard for you, yes. What about your memory? Can you still remember things reasonably well?
Speaker_01: At the moment not at all. At the moment I can’t remember anything.
Speaker_00: I’d also like to do a small task for that. I’ll tell you three words: Oslo, 24 and ashtray. Could you repeat them, please?
Speaker_01: Oslo, 24 and ashtray.
Speaker_00: Exactly. Please remember these three words. I’ll come back to them later in the conversation. Concentration is not so good, and you say your memory isn’t working all that well either.
How about finding your way around – in terms of place and time, knowing the date, finding your way around the streets of Mannheim?
Speaker_01: Well, I don’t go out anymore anyway.
Speaker_00: Mhm. But you know where you are here?
Speaker_01: Yes, I do.
Speaker_00: Namely?
Speaker_01: ZI.
Speaker_00: ZI. Yes. Yes. And do you know what date it is today?
Speaker_01: Yes, the 6.2.25.
Speaker_00: That’s absolutely correct.
Do you also know the day of the week?
Speaker_01: Thursday.
Speaker_00: Thursday, exactly. That’s right.
Yes. Um. Since you’ve been in the clinic, have you still been having these severe suicidal thoughts, thoughts of killing yourself?
Speaker_01: Oh,
maybe not quite as bad anymore, but only a very, very little bit less bad.
Speaker_00: And if the thoughts got worse, would you be able to reliably let someone know?
Speaker_01: I could do that.
Speaker_00: Yes, okay, then we can trust you on that. Yes, good.
Now I’d like to ask a few more questions that may not have much to do with your current symptoms, but for the sake of completeness they also belong in a first interview. Have there ever been times in your life when you had what we call perceptual disturbances?
Speaker_01: No. I don’t know anything like that.
Speaker_00: Hearing voices or seeing ghosts or whatever…
Speaker_01: I always just worked a lot and did my duty.
Speaker_00: Have there ever been times in your life when you felt other people could manipulate or read your thoughts?
Speaker_01: No, not that either.
Speaker_00: Ever had times in your life when you felt that something about your body was changing in a strange, uncanny way?
Speaker_01: No, not that either.
Speaker_00: Speaking of change – you said you didn’t go out much. But when you did go out, did the world look the same to you as it usually does, or different?
Speaker_01: Boring.
Speaker_00: Um, were the colors still just as intense, the sounds, the birdsong still the same?
Speaker_01: Probably, but I… I just have the future in my head.
Speaker_00: Um.
Speaker_01: So I can’t, I don’t enjoy birdsong either.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: That weighs on me too, and then I’m ashamed again because I have no joy at all. Yes, in things you’re actually… where you’re supposed to be happy.
Speaker_00: Supposed to, yes, or where many people are happy.
Speaker_01: Or people always say, “Go out in the fresh air, or into the sun.” Pff. Then the sun is there and I think, now I’m supposed to be happy about the sun. But I’m not.
Speaker_00: Mhm, yes.
I know that from other patients too, they’ve told me that. Have there ever been times in your life when you had so-called compulsions?
By that I mean having to do or think certain things over and over, checking a hundred times whether the stove is turned off, or having to count your steps when you walk, or having to step on certain stones. Have you ever had anything like that?
No, you don’t know that.
Ever had inappropriate fears, like fear of dogs, snakes, spiders, high bridges?
You don’t know that either.
Speaker_01: I don’t know, it was all normal. Yes, it was all normal. I don’t recognize myself like this.
Speaker_00: Yes, yes.
Speaker_01: I don’t know myself like this.
Speaker_00: Yes.
Speaker_01: Otherwise everything was always normal.
Speaker_00: Mhm. Do you still remember the three words I told you earlier?
Speaker_01: Oh, wait a moment. There was a city. Oslo.
Speaker_00: Right.
Speaker_01: And then there was a number.
I don’t remember that anymore. And I think ashtray.
Speaker_00: Right.
Speaker_01: I don’t remember the number.
Speaker_00: The number was 24. But you remembered two of them.
Speaker_01: Yes.
Speaker_00: Yes. We’ve now talked about many things. I’ve asked you a lot. Oh, perhaps one more question, just for completeness: have there ever been times in your life when you thought other people wanted to harm you or even persecute you?
Speaker_01: No.
Speaker_00: That’s never been an issue. Yes. Yes. Yes. Good.
Is there anything – I’ve asked you a lot, but it can happen that I’ve forgotten something important from your point of view. Is there anything you’d like to add?
Speaker_01: Maybe I could have a bit more pain medication.
Speaker_00: I’d ask you to…
Speaker_01: For my hip.
Speaker_00: Yes, okay, I can well understand that.
I’d ask you to speak to the ward doctor about that again. He could prescribe something appropriate. Finally, once more back to the beginning: you told me what kind of conversation this is and what purpose it serves. Could you repeat it once more? Why is this recording being made?
Why is our conversation being recorded?
Speaker_01: Somehow for studying or something like that.
Speaker_00: Yes,
exactly.
Good.
Yes, then all that remains is for me to wish you all the best. Like your GP, I also believe that you can get well again. What do the doctors say you have?
Speaker_01: Depression.
Speaker_00: Do you believe that?
Because not everything doctors say is necessarily true.
Speaker_01: Yes, somehow I do believe it.
Speaker_00: Yes.
I also think that’s correct. And I think you’ll receive good treatment here. And I’m keeping my two thumbs pressed for you that you get well again and can enjoy your life and your grandchildren.
Speaker_01: Thank you.
Speaker_00: All the best. So, then
I’ll say goodbye now.
Goodbye.
Bye.
